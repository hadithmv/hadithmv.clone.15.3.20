If there are any disputes regarding the meaning of these terms and conditions, then the conflict will be resolved in accordance to the Developer’s interpretation.

It is not allowed to use Hadithmv to spread what goes against the methodology of Ahlu-Sunnah-wal-Jamaa’ah (Ahlul Hadith), except to refute Ahlul-Bid’ah (the Jahmiyya, Ashaa’irah, Murjiah, Khawarij, Rawafid, Sufiyyah, Mu’tazilah, Maatureedhiyyah, Qadariyyah, etc.)

    1 - The texts used from Hadithmv are less than 300 words.
    2 - The use is not for commercial purposes.
Otherwise, permission is to be sought from the Developer first before use, if the Developer is alive.
