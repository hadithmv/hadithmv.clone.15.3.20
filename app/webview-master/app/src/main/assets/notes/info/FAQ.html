Student of the Hadith Faculty, Islamic University of Madina.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>I have a suggestion / correction / question. How can I contact you?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Click on the "chat with us" button on the lower right of this page.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Is hadithmv on social media?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Yes, hadithmv can be found on Facebook, Viber, Telegram, Instagram and Twitter. See the very bottom of this page for links.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How do I use hadithmv?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Please read about that <b><a href=../how-to-use-hmv.txt>here</a></b>.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How do I continue from the last place I was at a later time?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">In the web version of hadithmv, the page will stay as is even if you close the browser, or alternatively you can save the URL. Otherwise you can note down the page number where you were and input that to continue from there, this method can be used in the app.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Is there an app?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Yes. While hadithmv is primarily available online on the web, it is also available offline as an Android and Windows app.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Is there an iOS app?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Not yet. However, iOS users can get the same functionality as the android app from the mobile web version of hadithmv. In sha Allah there will be an iOS app, contact us if you would like to help with making one.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Can I join the hadithmv project?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">We are looking for people who have skills in on or all of these three: Dhivehi, Arabic, and programming. Roles include translating, proof-reading and coding. Contact us for more information if you want to join.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What are you looking for in volunteers?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Applicants should be self-motivated, responsive, able to meet deadlines, and not feel offended when corrected.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How else can I help hadithmv?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">You can also help by rating the app, note that you can rate without showing your name if you don't write anything. Another way to assist is by sharing hadithmv with your friends. If you ever wanted to spread Islamic knowledge in Dhivehi, or maybe even thought about distributing a great many books to Maldivians all around the world so that they can benefit, then sharing hadithmv is as easy as it gets.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Who else participates in the hadithmv project?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">hadithmv has had various helpers over time. Most of them are friends and colleagues from the Islamic University of Madina, as well as people who are skilled in the Dhivehi and Arabic language, as well as those who help with programming. For a list of contributors please click <b><a href=introHmv.html>here</a></b>.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Why is it called hadithmv? and why are there things other than hadith on it?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">It started out as a website providing the Dhivehi translation of Nawawi's 40 hadith, then later developed into much more than that. While the main focus will always be on reviving the Sunnah and making it accessible for everyone, it became important to include everything that helps in achieving that goal. The most important of which would be the Quran without a doubt, followed by books on the correct Aqida. Supporting language material for learning Arabic and translating was also found to be indispensable.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What can I do on hadithmv?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">You can read various Islamic translations of Quran, Hadith, Aqida, Duas etc. You can use hadithmv like a dictionary. You can find the source references for these books. You can lookup texts in Dhivehi as well as Arabic, and can search even without Arabic diacritics. You can copy and paste the translations from and to any device, through any kind of media. You can select how many items to display on the screen at one time. You can jump to any page. You can use filter options to see only specific texts. You can show and hide different types of text. You can use keyboard shortcuts on the desktop.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>I messed up the search / settings on hadithmv, how do I reset them?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">If you are on the app then simply fully closing the app and opening it anew will reset it. If you are on the web version then clear the search box, clear the selected options, set the number of items viewed to 1, and deselect the extra columns you have chosen to show. Or just clear the cache from the browser and go to that page anew.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Is hadithmv free?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Of course. It has been and always will be free, in sha Allah.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Who funds hadithmv?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">hadithmv is currently funded by the developer and no one else.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How is hadithmv different?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">It is the first program of its kind in the Dhivehi language, and as far as we are aware, the only.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Where is hadithmv based?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">In the Maldives, although most of the code and content was written in Madina.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Who is hadithmv for?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Quite simply, everyone. From students to teachers, children to parents, and seekers of knowledge to scholars, etc.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Is hadithmv affiliated with any organization, whether governmental or an NGO?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">No, hadithmv is not affiliated with any organization. This project is run independantly and unaffected by the influences of third parties.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Are the translations correct?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Yes, in sha Allah. We strive to make them as accurate and understandable as possible. Please report any inaccuracies so that we may correct them as soon as possible.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Are the translations approved by the Islamic Ministry?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">The books approved by the Islamic Ministry will have an approval reference number on its about page. Others maybe in the making or pending approval.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Are all the hadith here authentic?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">If a hadith reference is from Bukhari or Muslim, then it is undoubtedly authentic. For any other book, the grading of a hadith scholar is needed before saying it is authentic. Some references do include such gradings, while others do not have them yet.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How do you source your arabic text?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">We usually rely upon the texts of the Shamela library program, unless specified otherwise. We look for the most accessible source for the text, as that is what most people will find easily available, then we use the best references we can find even if that is only in a hardcover book.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What numbering system do you use to reference hadith?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">We use the indexing scheme of Muhammad Fuad Abdul Baaqi wherever possible, as it is the most used and easiest to look up. Otherwise we use the numbering order found in the Shamela library program.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>When I looked up the reference number from a source, why did it not match?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Different editions and prints may use different numbering schemes. Make sure you looked up the same source books that we took the numberings from.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What are hadith?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">They are the sayings, actions, approvals as well as the physical characteristics and manners of Muhammad ﷺ, the last Prophet sent by Allah. Hadith is also called Sunnah. After the Quran, hadith is the second source of all sharia legislations as well as behavioural etiquette standards in Islam. We can only know what we should and should not do through the Messenger ﷺ. Following the Messenger ﷺ is the only way to salvation and all that is good, and choosing any other path is falling into wretchedness and destruction, in this world and the next.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What is Takhrij?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Takhreej is referencing the hadith text to the source book from which it is originally found.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Is there a dark mode / night theme?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">The site automatically switches the theme based on your system preferences, however the app does not as of yet.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What fonts does hadithmv use?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Mvtypewriter and Yakout.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What is the slogan of hadithmv?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">The Maldivian Hadith translation platform.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Why is the site different from the app?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">The site gets updated first, so the latest changes will always be available there. We only roll updates to the app a while after. This can even be seen in the difference of version numbers.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Why is a translation different from before?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">We might have corrected it or found a better translation. Here at hadithmv we do not believe in writing content once and then forgetting it. Rather it is possible to edit and update the text anytime. We are always striving to improve and build upon the translations, which are too important to just abandon at some point.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Why is a book on hadithmv incomplete?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Most likely because it is still in the process of being written and checked, it will be fully available once ready.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>I would like to know more about a particular book?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Check if there's a link to an about page where that book is found. Otherwise contact us for more information.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Which books are currently available?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">You can find those on the main page. We might have some other books ready, but awaiting further checks before being shared publicly. The content we have drafted and in-waiting is actually more than the content we show on the site.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Which books will be available soon?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">We focus mainly on hadith. But we also include content on Quran, Aqida, Duas and language when we feel it appropriate. So what we are currently working on will constantly be changing, consider joining the translation team to be in the loop.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Does hadithmv have any mirrors, in case the main site is down?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Yes, click <b><a href=https://hadithmv.gitlab.io>here</a></b>, or <b><a href=https://hadithmv.onrender.com>here</a></b>, or <b><a href=https://hadithmv.pages.dev>here</a></b>, or <b><a href=https://hadithmv.netlify.app>here</a></b>.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What will happen to hadithmv if something happens to you?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">That has been discussed within the team, and we have protocols in place so that the project may continue with or without me. It has already been decided which people are to take over and direct hadithmv, so there should be no worries about our work stopping, in sha Allah.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What is your Aqidah?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">My Aqida is that of Ahlu Sunnah wal Jama'ah. I follow the Quran and Sunnah upon the understanding of the Companions. I affirm the Names and Attributes of Allah as Allah and his Messenger ﷺ did, without changing their wording, interpreting them as metaphorical, denying them, likening them to the creation, or asking how they are. I hear and obey even if a slave is over me and I give advice to those in authority privately and not on the streets. This is what was taught in the Islamic University of Madina.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Why do you call yourself Yahyas Dad / Abu Yahya?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Because that is my Kunyah, which is a kind of arabic nickname where a person is called after their oldest child.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>When was hadithmv started?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Jul 17, 2017.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How do you make content so fast?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">It is mainly due to modernized workflow and tools, we tend to automate things as much as possible. This allows us to create a weeks worth of content that otherwise would have taken months had we done everything manually.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How is hadithmv licensed as a software?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Please read about that <b><a href=../../LICENSE.txt>here</a></b>.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What tools was hadithmv made with?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">Please read about that <b><a href=../third-party-libs-and-tools.txt>here</a></b>.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Why not make separate apps for all of the books?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">The purpose of hadithmv is to have everything accessible in one place. A centralized, unified approach is the most efficient in terms of size, speed and development. In short, to avoid redundancy and bloat. Otherwise a hundred books would be a hundred apps on each separate platform.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>I learned about a hadith, can I issue fatwa or answer fiqh questions?</b></a></h3><p class="en ind">No, that is only something the scholars can do. The Sharia of Allah is not spoken of except with knowledge. While hadithmv is intended to be a resource for various Islamic texts, one or two hadith alone is not sufficient for layman to have formed a comprehensive opinion on a matter. Many individuals who haven not studied even the basics of Islam or know even the slightest Arabic think that because they have the internet, they are as capable as any scholar. This is nothing but a fallacy. You cannot come up with your own fiqh nor make up your own analogy when it comes to Islam. Anything related to fiqh or fatwa should always be directed to the real scholars.</p><br></div><script>function openTab(e,t){for(var a,l=document.getElementsByClassName("tabcontent"),n=0;n<l.length;n++)l[n].style.display="none";for(a=document.getElementsByClassName("tablinks"),n=0;n<a.length;n++)a[n].className=a[n].className.replace(" active","");document.getElementById(t).style.display="block",e.currentTarget.className+=" active"}document.getElementById("defaultOpen").click()</script><br><hr><h2 class="en mid testimonials">– &nbsp;Feedback&nbsp; –</h2><style>.quotes{position:relative;max-width:25em;list-style-type:none;margin:0 auto;padding:0;direction:ltr}.quotes li{position:absolute;left:0;right:0;background:#0d619c;text-align:center;padding:1em;border-radius:.25em;opacity:0;padding-top:25px;color:#fff}.quotes li:last-child{position:relative}.quotes li::after{position:absolute;content:"";display:block;width:0;height:0;top:1.75em;left:-.75em;border-top:.75em solid transparent;border-bottom:.75em solid transparent;border-right:.75em solid #0b578c}.quotes span{display:block;text-align:right;margin-right:5%;font-size:85%;font-style:italic;color:#d6d6d6;padding-top:10px}.quotes li:nth-child(1){-webkit-animation:quote 30s 0s infinite;animation:quote 30s 0s infinite}.quotes li:nth-child(2){-webkit-animation:quote 30s 5s infinite;animation:quote 30s 5s infinite}.quotes li:nth-child(3){-webkit-animation:quote 30s 10s infinite;animation:quote 30s 10s infinite}.quotes li:nth-child(4){-webkit-animation:quote 30s 15s infinite;animation:quote 30s 15s infinite}.quotes li:nth-child(5){-webkit-animation:quote 30s 20s infinite;animation:quote 30s 20s infinite}.quotes li:nth-child(6){-webkit-animation:quote 30s 25s infinite;animation:quote 30s 25s infinite}@-webkit-keyframes quote{0%{opacity:0}4%{opacity:1}13%{opacity:1}17%{opacity:0}}@keyframes quote{0%{opacity:0}4%{opacity:1}13%{opacity:1}17%{opacity:0}}.stars{padding-top:15px}.testimonials{padding-top:15px}</style><ul class=quotes id=quotes><li class=show>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<span class=stars></span>“This is a very needed app for the maldivian community.
