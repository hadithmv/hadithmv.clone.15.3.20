    <!-- 
     in the faq, it did say the following:
     
Besides adding UnitOf to my project, are there any other dependencies needed?

A BigInteger library is only required for JavaScript's version of UnitOf.NumericBase.The following was used in developing/testing UnitOf and is recommended: https://peterolson.github.io/BigInteger.js/BigInteger.min.js

and it seems that is already included as it works out of the box

    <!-- i got this ext js link from their site: https://digidemic.github.io/UnitOf/
     got the unimified version as it contains needed comments that explain how it works

    this is a measurement and data type conversion library
20+ complete units of measure.
Parse any programming data type or convert fractions without any errors.
Ability to create your own custom UnitOf measurements.
Small, fast, and easy to use with super simple syntax.

Palindrome Conversion Algorithm
- How UnitOf converts under the hood -

Behind the scenes, UnitOf is using an in-house developed conversion algorithm, which we believe is the most efficient way to convert units of measurement.
Simply put, almost all conversions are achieved using the defined list of units of the measurement which have all been pre-converted from or into a key unit of the same measurement. More complex conversions like temperature use a set of equations and the inverse functions of those same equations that convert from/into the key unit rather than using a pre-converted list of units. When a conversion is executed, its "from" unit/value and "to" unit are plugged into the this pre-converted list of units (or equations in some cases) which then use basic arithmetic to return a conversion.

In other words, a combination of 2 unique equations are used: The first equation to convert the starting unit/value into the chosen key unit of the same measurement. The second equation to convert this newly converted number into the destination unit. This is all found by knowing how to convert all units into a single chosen (key) unit.

...


Example usage:
//One Liner
var a = UnitOf.Mass.fromPounds(5).toKilograms; //2.26796 returned as 5 pounds is 2.26796 kilograms

//Set Then Convert
var feet = UnitOf.Length.fromFeet(5.5); //Instantiate UnitOf.Length and set "feet" as 5.5
var b = feet.toInches; //66 returned as 5.5 feet is 66 inches
var c = feet.toMeters; //1.6764 returned as 5.5 feet is 1.6764 meters

//Convert Data Type and Fractions
var d = UnitOf.DataType("12.5").toFloat(); //12.5 of type Float returned. 0 would be returned if conversion failed
var e = UnitOf.DataType("Not A Number").toInt(10); //10 of type Int returned since conversion fails
var f = UnitOf.DataType(0.5).toFraction(); //"1/2" of type string returned. Empty string would be returned if failed

//Create your own custom measurement
var x = UnitOf.Anything("FEET", 1, true, {METERS:0.3048, INCHES:12}); //Custom measurement w/ 3 units
var g = x.convertNow(36, "INCHES", "FEET"); //3 returned as 36 inches is 3 feet
var h = x.convertNow("3", "FEET", "METERS"); //0.9144 returned as 3 feet is 0.9144 meters
