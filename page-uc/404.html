          If the page page you were trying to view does not exist; either
          because the URL address was incorrect, or the page you were looking
          for has moved, then you can:

            when importing a git repository, change name from hadithmv-github-io to hadithmv, otherwise browser shows this warning prompt thinking it should redirect to .github.io
            ...
            couldnt get vercel to work at first,
            ...
             i think i found the problem, it is the "package.json" file at the root dir that was interfering, i had added that to try making a mirror out of cyclic, which did not succeed
             ...
             before i thought one of these solved the issue:
          ...
          1. left framework preset at jekyll, and the first four commands and directory empty.
          2. root directory was left empty, and include source files outside root directory is checked
          3 settings: advanced: Directory Listing: If no index file is present within a directory, the directory contents will be displayed. (enabled and saved this)
          4. created a folder named 'public' in the root dir, and placed a copy of the index file there
          ...
          dont think this is of any consequence: "Configuration Settings in the current Production deployment differ from your current Project Settings."
          placing a .gitlab-ci.yml file in root dir
          dont think this is of any consequence: changing output directory to "_site"
          jekyll build
    
          bundle install
          bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --port $PORT
          ...
          sometimes the domains under deployment show one main link, sometimes they show an addition two branching links?

Currently only supports GitHub.com. Before use, you need to bind your mobile phone number (Click here to bind) and authorize your GitHub account. Git LFS is not supported for now; The maximum timeout time for a single synchronization is 30 minutes. Large repository synchronizing is not recommended. Click here to learn more. At present, this feature is open for a limited time until December 31, 2023. We will update our product strategy before the end of the limited-time open period. -->

          ⚠️ Sometimes there are upgrades happening on the site, which is the
          always the latest version of Hadithmv. If you are unable to find what
          you are looking for during such a time, try using Mirror 5, or the
          Windows or Android apps, as they will have an older version.
