Renamed to Tharujamaanu ID
Removed locl feature. Thaana glyphs are used.

"regular" recommended from here, a little bit lighter than Faruma, better for light text on dark.

both have merged arabic

Both have same glyphs. But localized variants doesn't work for Thaana on ID.

See FDF2 glyph, punctuations, etc. Also, look at colon, lower period position, narrower space, different quotation marks, etc., on the bottom image.

It's using glyphs set for Latin script.
So OpenType feature that does it has been disabled for use.
For ID, a regular weight between light and bold was added.
In Word, light version cannot be chosen?

ID version might have issues with Arabic and Latin, but Thaana would work perfectly as intended.

Install to ID fonts folder then
