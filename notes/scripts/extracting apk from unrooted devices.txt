1) extracting apk

!!!in COMMAND PROMPT, not powershell:

go to where adb is and open a terminal there, change path to there
cd C:\Users\ashra\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools

check with:
adb devices

list apps:
adb shell pm list packages

find the app package name you are looking for first, maybe ctrl + a, then paste in word and search:
mv.edu.dhivehiacademy.radheef

find path:
adb shell pm path com.example.someapp
adb shell pm path mv.edu.dhivehiacademy.radheef

this is the full path: (without the 'package:')
/data/app/~~Fma010ard44kRdLuzqS2aA==/mv.edu.dhivehiacademy.radheef-sPBL-9xCHBu0igx1wWLjgA==/base.apk

pull it out and copy it elsewhere:
adb pull /data/app/com.example.someapp-2.apk path/to/desired/destination
adb pull /data/app/~~Fma010ard44kRdLuzqS2aA==/mv.edu.dhivehiacademy.radheef-sPBL-9xCHBu0igx1wWLjgA==/base.apk
(if you dont give a destination, it will have it copied to the adm destination from the beginning)

...

* if getting the below error
adb: error: failed to get feature set: more than one device/emulator
write
adb -s (specify which device using the code given when you ran 'adb devices')
adb -s 9P4PHQ4PNFKZ8H75 pull /data/app/~~Fma010ard44kRdLuzqS2aA==/mv.edu.dhivehiacademy.radheef-sPBL-9xCHBu0igx1wWLjgA==/base.apk

...

2) getting db file in data/data/... directory

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13006315/how-to-access-data-data-folder-in-android-device

 adb backup -noapk com.your.packagename
 adb backup -noapk mv.edu.dhivehiacademy.radheef

 WARNING: adb backup is deprecated and may be removed in a future release
Now unlock your device and confirm the backup operation...

should be saved in adb dir as: backup.ab

The resulting 'backup.ab' file on your computer contains all application data in android backup format. Basically it's a compressed tar file.

https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-backup-processor/
(probably can just get Files/abp.jar instead of the 100mb+ android-backup-tookit-20221220)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18533567/how-to-extract-or-unpack-an-ab-file-android-backup-file


cd to where abp.jar is
java -jar path/to/abe.jar unpack path_to/backup.ab path_for_generated/backup.tar
java -jar abp.jar unpack backup.ab backup.tar

then unpack tar file with 7zip. thats all
