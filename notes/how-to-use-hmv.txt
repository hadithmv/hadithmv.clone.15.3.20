Click on the top navbar to open the menu.
Open a book to begin browsing.
Use the search box to look up words.
Use the show 1 box to select how many items to show.
Use the page buttons to move forward or backward. (Can also swipe to change pages on mobile, which is much easier)

Use the Copy button to copy all visible data.
Use the Extra Columns button to show or hide specific data.

After searching, you can double click on a search result to jump to the page where that result comes from.

If you are using Hadithmv from the website, the place where you were reading stays saved even if you close the browser. As for the app, you can click the "copy current page link" button at the bottom of a page and save that link to continue from there later on.

* Desktop Keyboard Shortcuts:

[Tab] = Tab Navigation
[Arrow Keys] = Keyboard Navigation
[Shift + S] = Show Additional Columns
[Shift + C] = Copy shown text to clipboard
[Shift + F] = Open Filter
[Shift + L] = Copy current page as web URL to clipboard

Cursor starts already inside the search box on desktop
(So to use desktop keyboard shortcuts, you must click outside the search box first)
