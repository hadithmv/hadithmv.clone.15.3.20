        Not yet. The reason for that being that I myself don’t use an iPhone nor

        flutter or react native, thinking it might generate a fair bit of the
        overhead and bloat, as opposed to how compact I’ve been able to make the
        current Android and Windows apps. Even so, iOS, macOS and Linux users
        can get the same functionality as the Android app from the mobile web
        version of Hadithmv. In sha Allah there will be an iOS app, contact us
        if you would know someone who could help in that area.

      <p class="en justi inde">
        We are always looking out for people with skills in three key areas:
        Dhivehi, Arabic, and programming. Roles include translating,
        proof-reading and coding. Primarily, applicants should be optimistic,
        self-motivated, responsive, able to meet deadlines, and not feel
        offended when corrected. Obviously, we cannot work with translations
        that are done whenever one feels like doing it. Rather we follow a
        schedule, calculate our releases, and will not put a project on hold for
        anyone or anything. If there is too much delay on any one end, work will
        immediately be transferred to someone else, so as to not hold things up.
        That said, feel free to contact us to know more about joining Hadithmv.
      </p>

      <h3 class="en">
        <a><b>Why should I join?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        Well, while everyone has felt the lack of Dhivehi translations in the
        public sphere, there hasn’t been a good enough effort made for towards
        that till now. Everyone talks about doing it, yet virtually nothing has
        been done about. So we decided to get things going, and alhamdulillah,
        things have progressed a lot since we kickstarted this work. And by now,
        in joining Hadithmv, you’d be signing up for a well established project
        with years of experience, plenty of support, that is also open and
        welcoming. Unlike various other groups, we don’t keep ourselves and what
        we do in the dark, nor do we fail to respond when it comes to holding up
        our commitments. People have already seen that we do actually get things
        done, as our work is already out there for everyone else to access.
        Furthermore, while some may have one resource or another, like a PDF or
        so, we have already gone well beyond that, collecting all that and much
        more. We also utilize specialized tools and modernized resources for the
        job, which aren’t limited to being either just digital or physical,
        which is the real bottleneck that everyone else faces. And this ensures
        that we are able to get our content up and out there as quickly and
        efficiently as possible, and thus the team is able to continuously build
        upon a proven flow of work, instead of having to start out from absolute
        zero. So be a part of this project, and help out with making these
        important Islamic text available for all. After the permission of Allah,
        we are only able to release this project because of your help. May Allah
        reward all those who participated in this abundantly and perpetually.
        Any good that comes of this is from Allah, and any shortcomings are from
        ourselves and shaithan. O Allah, please accept and bless this work of
        ours, and make it from our good deeds. Let it be a Sadaqa Jariya that
        remains until the Day of Judgement. And forgive the brothers and sisters
        who participated in it, as well as their families and friends. Ameen.

        <a><b>How else can I help Hadithmv?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        One way is by rating the Android app. Note that you can rate without
        showing your name if you don’t write anything. Another way is by sharing
        Hadithmv with your friends. If you ever wanted to spread Islamic
        knowledge in Dhivehi, or maybe even thought about distributing a lot of
        books to Maldivians all around the world, then in this day and time
        sharing Hadithmv is as easy as it gets. Furthermore, the Prophet ﷺ said:
        “Whoever guides someone to goodness will have a reward like one who did
        it.” -Sahih Muslim 1893.

      <p class="en justi inde">
        Hadithmv has had various helpers over time. Most of them are friends and
        colleagues from the Islamic University of Madinah, as well as brothers
        and sisters who studied in other colleges and faculties, along with
        other students of knowledge, skilled linguists in the Dhivehi and Arabic
        languages, and others who help with the code itself. For a list of
        contributors please click

        utilize this
        <a href="https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/overview">specification</a>
        when it comes to contributions, because we realize that people like you
        and me are giving ourselves and our free time to contribute in so many
        ways. That said, we will not allow false Aqidas to be hosted here on
        Hadithmv.

        While hadithmv initially started as a website providing the Dhivehi
        translation of Nawawi’s 40 hadith, it has since developed into much
        more. While the primary focus will always be on reviving the Sunnah and
        making it accessible for everyone, it became important to include
        everything that would help in achieving that goal. The most important of
        which would be the Quran, followed by books on the correct Aqida.
        Supporting language material regarding Arabic was also found to be
        indispensable. Other useful tools and content have also made available,
        for those who wish to benefit from them. At the same time, it won’t hurt
        non-technical people if it’s there either.

        <a><b>What can I do on Hadithmv?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        Primarily you can read various Islamic translations of Quran, Hadith,
        Aqidah, Duas as well as other content. You can also use Hadithmv like a
        dictionary. You can find the source references for these books. You can
        look up texts in Dhivehi as well as Arabic, and can search even without
        Arabic diacritics. You can copy and paste the translations to and from
        any device, through any kind of media. You can select how many items to
        display on the screen at one time. You can jump to any page. You can use
        filter options to see only specific texts. You can show and hide
        different types of text. You can also use keyboard shortcuts on the
        desktop, etc. Please click

        If you are on the app, then simply closing the app fully and then
        opening it again will reset it. If you are on the web version then clear
        the search box, clear the selected options, set the number of items
        viewed to default, and deselect the extra fields you have chosen to
        show. Or you can just fully clear the cache from the browser and revisit
        to that page again by pressing (Ctrl + Shift + R).

        We are providing our content free of charge, and it will remain that
        way, in sha Allah. Because we know first-hand that knowledge does not
        decrease when shared and made accessible to all, it only increases.

      <h3 class="en">
        <a><b>How is Hadithmv different?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        It is the first program of its kind in the Dhivehi language, and as far
        as we are aware, the only. Another game-changer is that here at
        Hadithmv, we fit with the times. We designed our content to load fast
        and use a fraction of your data. In more ways than one, Hadithmv saves
        you time and money, because every byte counts. Furthermore, we like to
        keep things minimal yet modern. We don’t spend our time creating flashy
        animations or searching for filler photographs to go with what to write.
        We realized early on that a one size fits all approach and readily
        available templates does the job much more efficiently. This way we can
        focus on what is important, delivering quality content instead of
        worrying about trivial secondary matters. Nor do we limit ourselves to
        bulky hard-coded PDFs that are hard to read on mobile devices, and
        sometimes impossible to search text in. Rather our content is responsive
        and easily searchable, with custom options like copying or choosing how
        many items to display. Furthermore, we don’t do things in waves that
        come and go, or get people worked up on something for short bursts that
        inevitably fade away. Instead, we aim for steady work and sure outcomes
        that are designed to last. And when it comes to social media, we keep
        things bite-sized so subscribers can follow along even on a busy
        schedule. These days, there is a lot less need to ferry people or books
        back and forth across the country, that ship has sailed long ago. And
        even PDFs are fast becoming dinosaurs. The generation of today expects
        whole electronic libraries to fit responsively within their pockets and
        be able to use them easily and immediately within a snap, we hope to
        continue delivering on those expectations, in sha Allah.

      <h3 class="en">
        <a><b>Could you record video and audio to go with the hadith?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        Fundamentally, we work in making the source texts available for
        everyone, as everything is built on that. Once that resource is readily
        out there, it becomes so much easier for others to create multimedia
        based on it. This is why we have chosen to invest most of our time and
        effort in this essential area, as it is more important in the long term
        than spending hours and hours recording or editing other media. As the
        years go by, images will become pixelated and blurry as they keep
        getting reuploaded and compressed over and over again. Videos will also
        become outdated as search algorithms will push them further back as new
        ones come out to replace them. As for audio, one thing is how much of a
        hassle it is to go back and re-record things whenever a change in script
        is called for, and it is almost inevitable that Dhivehi text-to-speech
        engines will develop to a point where they will accurately read whole
        books for you, instead of you having to rely on people to keep recording
        and editing clips all the time just so you can listen to them. In brief,
        we concern ourselves with long term, long lasting goals instead of
        temporary short term ones. Because the reality is that a lot of
        channels, groups, domains, blogs, posts, articles, web documents etc.
        have all come and gone, leaving not a trace of what once was. But
        without a doubt, there is one thing that remains the same; the
        fundamental value of the core text, which will keep getting reused and
        built upon over time and time again, and so that is precisely where we
        have chosen to commit to.

      <h3 class="en">
        <a><b>How does Hadithmv make content so quickly?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        It is mainly due to our modernized workflow and tools. Instead of
        tediously having to do everything manually, we tend to automate things
        as much as possible. This allows us to create a month’s worth of content
        that otherwise would have taken others years to do by hand. We avoid
        doing things over and over again and suffice with scripts wherever
        possible, as we find manual repetition to be extremely cumbersome and a
        waste of time. Inevitably, modern methods will always outstrip legacy
        ones when it comes to performance and delivery, no matter the numbers,
        even though by the Grace of Allah we have writers such that some of them
        are worth 50 others. Furthermore, we use a lot of software to help with
        our work, some of which we have
        <a href="../third-party-libs-and-tools.txt">mentioned</a>
        or made <a href="text-editor.html">available</a> for use on the site.

        conveying the texts. Unfortunately, we see some people trying on their
        own to piece together a translation word-for-word, and then end up
        failing to understand both the text as well as the context. It is
        important to point out that just a dictionary will never, ever be enough
        to translate Islamic texts. One needs to have proper knowledge of
        related Islamic sciences such as Nahu, Fiqh, Usool, Mustalah, Ruwat,
        etc. and even then, they would have to refer to the Explanations of the
        scholars if they wish to translate anything accurately. Otherwise they
        will just end up misleading themselves as well as others.

        If a hadith is from Bukhari or Muslim, then it is undoubtedly authentic.
        For any other book, the grading of a hadith scholar is required before
        saying it is authentic. Some references on Hadithmv do include such
        gradings, while others do not have them yet.

        They are the sayings, actions, approvals as well as the physical

        Allah. Hadith is also called Sunnah. After the Quran, hadith is the
        second source of all Sharia legislations as well as behavioural
        etiquette standards in Islam. We can only know what we should and should
        not do through the Messenger ﷺ. Following the Messenger ﷺ is the only
        way to salvation and all that is good, and choosing any other path is
        falling into wretchedness and destruction, in this world as well as the

        article that sees no changes. Rather it is possible to edit and update
        the our texts anytime. Think of it in terms of a ‘living standard’. We
        are always striving to improve and build upon the translations, which
        are too important to just write once and then abandon later on.

        My Aqeeda is that of Ahlu Sunnah wal Jama’ah. These are the
        <a href="https://hadithmv.github.io/books/barbahari.html">beliefs</a>
        I hold. I follow the Quran and Sunnah upon the understanding of the
        Companions and those who followed them in righteousness. I affirm the
        Names and Attributes of Allah as He and His Messenger ﷺ did, without
        changing their wording, interpreting them as metaphorical, denying them,
        likening them to the creation, or asking how they are. I hear and obey
        even if a slave is put over me, and I give advice to those in authority
        privately and not on the streets. This is what I was taught at the
        Islamic University of Madina. And as such, I will not allow any other
        creeds to show up in any of the content here. Another important reason
        why this project had to happen was because of the widespread Ash’ari
        misinterpretations that had plagued the existing local translations of
        Quran and hadith. This had gone on for too enough without enough people
        coming forth to cleanse them of the various inserted deviations they
        held. Despite Aqida being a major issue, problems such as these still
        persisted throughout generations of Maldivians, even with the presence
        of over 300 Islamic graduates. But in sha Allah, we aim to solve that
        issue once and for all. May Allah grant us Thaufeeq. Ameen.

        The key idea is to have everything accessible in one place. A
        centralized, unified approach is the most efficient in terms of size,
        speed and development. In short, we did things this way to avoid
        redundancy and bloat. Otherwise a hundred books would be a hundred apps
        on each separate platform, which would be very inefficient to maintain.
        Imagine if the Shamela Islamic Library had a seperate program or app for
        each of their books, with multiple database engines that needed
        updating. Now you can understand exactly how difficult and ineffective
        that would be for the end user as well as the programmer.

        <a><b>Why is it hadithmv.github.io instead of hadithmv.com?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        Also related to this matter, is how some say that making people write
        .github.io in the URL of the browser will take too long. In response, I
        would say, who types out full URLs in the browser in this day and age?
        One only needs to google a mere word of the site name and they will find
        themselves there in no time. Not to mention how modern browsers
        autocomplete the URL for you the moment you write even a single letter.
        Nevertheless, while Hadithmv has always been built and hosted on github
        instead of a seperate domain, I do own
        <a href="https://hadithmv.com">hadithmv.com</a>. And that site redirects
        back to this one here on github. I don’t do it the other way around
        because of the temporary nature of custom domains, which in reality only
        last as long as they are maintained and paid for. We have seen time and
        again, how so many many Islamic sites that were once filled with so much
        content, die off along with everything that was in them. Unfortunately,
        most site owners choose to be exclusive and closed, not allowing their
        content anywhere else, nor making backups, and not sharing their data
        accessibly. So their work ceased to exist because they ended up not
        paying for the costs needed to keep their site up which of course
        becomes much more expensive if one does not know their way around code
        and the web, or they became too busy in their personal lives to continue
        with it, or stopped updating their sites to fit with modern times as
        technology progressed, or disputes arose within their team and they end
        up breaking off from each other and stagnating, or in the worst case
        scenario, the content creators themselves had rely all their lives on IT
        people who came and went just like that, or were limited to basic third
        party software and never went beyond the realm of clicking buttons and
        writing regular old text just like everyone else. On the other hand,
        technically inclined people may want to make an Islamic site or app, yet
        don’t have the acquired Islamic knowledge to do so, and have to rely on
        those who do, but those end up not having the time, effort or
        consistency required for such a task. The reverse can also happen, where
        some with Islamic knowledge are not able to learn or adapt to changing
        technology, while brothers in IT are too busy with commercial work to
        give time to an Islamic project. In short, conflicts, inabilities,
        dependencies and bottlenecks etc. are usually what stagnate and kill off
        such projects. Similar to these situations is how some only release
        their work merely in the form of hardcopy books to be placed on shelves,
        or make do with a channel on limited social media, or worse, give out
        just a PDF, and don’t bother doing any more than that. If only the
        creators made their content available openly on the web and apps,
        accessible on all media and platforms, kept up with the changing trends
        of development, and had proper mirrors and backups, people could have
        still continued to benefit even if the site disappeared. However, we
        have tried our level best to avoid becoming like that, which is
        ultimately why we are on github and won’t expire the way other domains
        do. We have also gone beyond that and prepared several
        <a href="mirror-backups.html">mirrors</a> to keep the content alive.
        because knowledge is simply too precious to let vanish. And last but not
        the least, in addition to our text content, we have also placed all our
        code out there in public, so that those who come later on will be able
        to continue and improve upon it. And certainly more people in the future
        will be able to read and write code than now, of course.

        No, that is only something the scholars can do, because the Sharia of
        Allah is not spoken of except with knowledge. While Hadithmv is intended
        to be a resource for various Islamic texts, one or two hadith alone is
        not sufficient for laymen to have formed a comprehensive opinion on a
        matter. Many individuals who have not studied even the most basic
        Islamic books or know only the slightest bit of Arabic think that just
        because they have the internet, they are as capable as any scholar. This
        is nothing but a complete and utter fallacy. You cannot come up with
        your own reasoning nor make up your own analogy when it comes to Islamic
        rulings. That is simply not how things work in this Deen. Anything
        related to Fiqh or Fatwa should always be directed to the scholars.
        Otherwise, one will only go astray, while leading others astray as well.
