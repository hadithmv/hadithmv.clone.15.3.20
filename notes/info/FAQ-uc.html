        <a><b>What is Hadithmv?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        Hadithmv is a free software and resource for Islamic texts and
        supplementary works in the Dhivehi language, for use by students and
        scholars of knowledge as well as the common people. Hadithmv is currently available
        as a website, as well as an Android and Windows app, it provides the
        functions of searching and and copying text. This service is provided at
        no cost and is intended to use as is. Read more in the introduction to
        Hadithmv

        <a><b>Who created and maintains Hadithmv?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        (Abu Yahya) Mohamed Ashraaf Ibrahim. Student of the Hadith Faculty at

        <a><b>What is the purpose of Hadithmv?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        I saw that the people of my time (between the 20th and 21st century) were far from the Sunnah, the Righteous Predecessors, as well as holding onto them. These people, both the laymen as well as those who claimed they were practising, would give precedence to their intellects above the Aathaar/Narrations, and either distort them to fit their views, or reject them one way or another. There was also much spread of innovation in religious matters and it was made fair seeming to the masses. And those who knew no better took ignorant and misguided individuals as masters and Imams. And so I created a digital resource for the people that could be a means of reminding them of the Sunnah and holding onto it, and what the Righteous Predecessors of the Ummah and the scholars of narrations were upon. And that they might be warned from deviant innovations and desires and refrain from them. And I ask Allah that He makes me and you firm upon Islam and the Sunnah, until we meet Him, without having changed or distorted anything from the religion, and that He makes us of those by whom the Sunnah is revived, and innovation is made to die off, and that He protects us from Fitnah, both from what is apparent from it as well as what is hidden. Ameen.

        The reason is that some browsers or antivirus software aren’t familiar

        can see

        Not yet. The reason for that being that I myself don’t use an iPhone nor

        bloat, as opposed to how compact the current Android and Windows apps
        are. Even so, iOS, macOS and Linux users can get the same functionality
        as the Android app from the web version of Hadithmv. In sha Allah there

        <a><b>Can I join the Hadithmv project?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        We are always looking for people with skills in three key areas:
        Dhivehi, Arabic, and programming. Roles include translating,
        proof-reading and coding. Primarily, applicants should be optimistic,
        self-motivated, responsive, able to meet deadlines, and not feel
        offended when corrected. We judge people by their speed and completeness of work, and things like friendship, popularity and certificates have little bearing if the aforementioned two factors have low scores. Obviously, we cannot work with translations that are done whenever one feels like doing it. Rather we follow a schedule, calculate our releases, and will not put a project on hold for anyone or anything. If there is too much delay on any one end, work will immediately be transferred to someone else, so as to not hold things up. That said, feel free to
        <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>
        to discuss more about joining Hadithmv. Also read our
        <a href="https://hadithmv.github.io/books/hadithmv-sitee.pdf">letter</a> regarding this in Dhivehi. While we wish that everyone benefits
        from this work as a whole, we also ask that you don’t just take and
        benefit for yourself, but also give back to the community by taking part
        in this project as well. Jazakumullah khairan.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3 class="en">
        <a><b>Why should I join?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        Well, while everyone has felt the lack of Dhivehi translations in the
        public sphere, there hasn’t been a good enough effort made towards that
        till now. Everyone talks about doing it, yet nowhere near enough has actually been done about it. So we decided to get this project up and running,
        and Alhamdulillah, things have progressed a lot since we kickstarted it. And by now, in joining Hadithmv, you’d be signing up for a well
        established project with years of experience, plenty of support, that is
        also open and welcoming. Unlike various other groups that have come and gone, we don’t keep
        ourselves and what we do in the dark, nor do we fail to respond when it
        comes to holding up our commitments. People have already seen that can
        and do actually get things done, as our work is already out there for
        everyone else to access. We don’t start working on something, do it halfway, and drop it. Furthermore, while some teams may have gotten ahold of one resource or another, like a PDF or so, we have already gone well beyond
        that, collecting all that and much more. We also utilize specialized
        tools and modernized resources for the job, which aren’t limited to
        being either just digital or physical, which is the real bottleneck that
        everyone else faces. And this ensures that we are able to get our
        content up and out there as quickly and efficiently as possible, and
        thus the team is able to continuously build upon a proven flow of work,
        instead of having to start out from absolute zero. Having the advantage
        of these tools and management is how 3 of our people end up turning out
        300 hadith translations in 3 months. Otherwise without a comparable
        setup or process, even 30 people would take years to get anything done.
        So be a part of this project, and help out with making these important
        Islamic text available for all. After the permission of Allah, we are
        only able to release this project because of the hard work of the writers. May Allah reward
        all those who participated in this abundantly and perpetually. Any good
        that comes of this is from Allah, and any shortcomings are from
        ourselves and shaithan. O Allah, please accept and bless this work of
        ours, and make it from our good deeds. Let it be a Sadaqa Jariya
        (continuous charity) that remains until the Day of Judgement. And
        forgive the brothers and sisters who participated in it, guide them to
        the true path, and keep them firm upon it, along with their families and
        friends. Ameen.

        <a><b>Can I work with Hadithmv but be nameless and anonymous?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        While on the one hand that is easy enough to do, take a moment to
        understand the bigger picture here. Yes, we should be sincere and not
        seeking praise. And indeed it is all about the reward and not the credits. Now
        to answer this issue, first of all, because software development is
        involved, it is important that we document our work. Secondly, the way
        of the people of hadith is to record everything, and noting down people
        and what they did is sort of their specialty. Thirdly, imagine if we
        were all nameless and anonymous, thinking it was he ideal way to go,
        then there would be no direction, no feedback, and no response. Say
        someone found a mistake somewhere, wanted to report it, but because we
        chose to hide ourselves, they ended up never being able to make it to us. And even
        if a few of us kept ourselves known while the rest were unreachable,
        people could get busy, contacts could change, and the known people could become
        inactive, while the unknown could then become the most active, which brings us back to the
        need to name names. Keeping a log is the responsible thing to do.
        Fourthly, one only needs to manage their heart and intentions, in order
        to be sincere and not praise-seeking, and if done properly, this should
        allow you to take credit for work rightfully done, it’s as simple as
        that. In the very least, allow us to list your Kunyah. And of course
        sisters can work with other sisters on these projects.

        <a><b>How else can I help with Hadithmv?</b></a>

        One way is by rating the Android app. Note that you can rate without
        showing your name if you don’t write anything. Another way is by sharing
        Hadithmv with your friends. If you ever wanted to spread Islamic
        knowledge in Dhivehi, or maybe even thought about distributing a lot of
        books to Maldivians all around the world, then in this day and age
        sharing Hadithmv is as easy as it gets. Furthermore, the Prophet ﷺ said:
        “Whoever guides someone to goodness will have a reward like one who did
        it.” -Sahih Muslim 1893.

        Hadithmv has had various helpers over time. Most of them are friends and
        colleagues from the Islamic University of Madinah, as well as brothers
        and sisters who studied in other colleges and faculties, along with
        other students of knowledge, skilled linguists in the Dhivehi and Arabic
        languages, and others who help with the code itself. For a list of

        While Hadithmv initially started as a website providing the Dhivehi
        translation of a small collection of 40 hadith, it has since developed into much more
        than that. While the primary focus will always be reviving the Sunnah
        and making it accessible for everyone, it became important to include
        everything that would help in achieving that goal. The most important of
        which would be the Quran, followed by books on the correct Aqida.
        Supporting language material regarding Arabic was also found to be
        indispensable. Other useful tools and content have also been made available 
        for those who wish to benefit from them. At the same time, it won’t hurt
        non-technical people in the slightest by its presence, even if they don’t know how to use it.

      <p class="en justi inde">
        The Hadithmv translation is based on the official Dhivehi translation we have in Maldives, but without the Ash’ari misinterpretations regarding Names and Attributes of Allah. The Arabic words that were in it have also been written in Dhivehi, and other linguistic improvements have also been made. As for Bakurubey’s translation, it is the work of Abu Bakr Ibrahim Ali, from Hinnavaru Island, who passed away on 20/1/2013. His translation has two parts, a (somewhat) word-to-word translation, and a general translation.

        No, that was made by brother Ahmed Ahsam, a developer from Hulhudhuffaaru. After the digitization of Bakurubey’s translation was completed on Hadithmv, he reached out to me and expressed interest in making a Flutter application for Bakurubeyge Tharujama. He then asked me for the data, which I provided. While making the app, he also asked whether it should be released under the Hadithmv developer account on the play store. I said it was preferrable to release it under his own developer account, so as to be able to directly maintain and update it better. And that it was enough to mention the source of the Hadithmv database and the version number it was taken from, so that we could know which typos came from which update.

      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        It is the first program of its kind in the Dhivehi language, and as far
        as we are aware, the only. We designed our content to load fast
        and use a fraction of your data. In more ways than one, Hadithmv saves
        you time and money, because every byte counts. Furthermore, we like to
        keep things minimal yet modern. We don’t spend time creating flashy
        animations or searching for filler photographs to go with what we write.
        We realized early on that a one size fits all approach and readily
        available templates do the job much more efficiently. This way we can
        focus on what is important, delivering quality content instead of
        worrying about trivial secondary matters. Nor do we limit ourselves to
        bulky hard-coded PDFs that are hard to read on mobile, and
        mostly impossible to search text in. Rather our content is responsive
        and easily searchable, with custom options like copying or choosing how
        many items to display. Furthermore, we don’t do things in waves that
        come and go, or get people worked up on something for short bursts that
        inevitably fade away. Instead, we aim for steady work and sure outcomes
        that are designed to last. And when it comes to social media, we keep
        things bite-sized so subscribers can follow along even on a busy
        schedule. These days, there is a lot less need to ferry people or books
        back and forth across the country, that ship has sailed long ago. And
        even PDFs are slowly becoming dinosaurs. The generation of today expects
        whole electronic libraries to be responsive, fit in their pockets and be immediately usable. We hope to
        continue delivering on those expectations, in sha Allah.

      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        Fundamentally, we work with making the source texts available for
        everyone, as everything else is built on that. Once that resource is
        readily out there, it becomes so much easier for others to create
        multimedia based on it. This is why we have chosen to invest most of our
        time and effort in this essential area, as it is more important in the
        long term than spending hours recording or editing other
        media. As the years go by, images will become pixelated and blurry as
        they keep getting reuploaded and compressed. Videos
        will become outdated as search algorithms push them further
        back as new ones replace them. As for audio, it is not worth the hassle to go back and re-record things whenever a
        change in script is called for, and it is almost inevitable that Dhivehi
        text-to-speech engines will progress to a point where they will
        accurately read whole books for us, instead of us having to rely on
        people to keep recording and editing clips all the time just so they can be listened to. In brief, we concern ourselves with long term, long
        lasting goals instead of temporary, short term ones. Because the reality
        is that a lot of channels, groups, domains, blogs, posts, articles, and so on have all come and gone, leaving not a trace of what once
        was. But without a doubt, there is one thing that remains the same; the
        fundamental value of the core text, which will keep getting reused and
        built upon over time and time again, and so that is precisely where we
        have chosen to commit to.

        content that otherwise would have taken others years to do by hand. We
        avoid doing things over and over again and suffice with scripts wherever
        possible, as we find manual repetition to be cumbersome and a
        waste of time. Inevitably, modern methods will always outstrip legacy
        ones when it comes to performance and delivery, no matter the numbers. Even though by the Grace of Allah we have writers such that some of them
        are worth 30 others. Furthermore, we use a lot of software to help with

        university-level people have translated texts, rechecked them several

        everything is to be translated literally, and the overall meaning must
        be preserved when conveying the texts. Unfortunately, we see some people
        trying on their own to piece together a translation word-for-word, and
        then end up failing to understand both the original text as well as the
        context. It must be pointed out that just a dictionary will never, ever
        be enough to translate Islamic texts such as these. One needs to have
        proper knowledge of related Islamic sciences such as Nahu, Fiqh, Usool,
        Mustalah, Ruwat, etc. and even then, they would have to refer to the
        explanations of the scholars if they wish to translate anything
        accurately. Otherwise one will just end up misleading oneself as well as

        >
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        Absolutely not. First of all that is very unacademic. There are standards and protocols in place so that people can look up hadith from their original sources with ease and cross reference the texts for themselves. Not doing so is a betrayal of credibilty that shows a lack of care and diligence when it comes to handling these texts. Proper referencing is one way by which the liars can be told apart from the truthful, because why else would anyone try to hide their sources? The same is true for telling apart the fake hadith from the sound ones. We even see that the Orientalists and non-muslims take care to mention the sources and indexes of the texts they criticize, because they know that without it what they write is worthless.  Secondly, it is considered lazy habit. Adding the half-baked sentences “Source: -Prophetic Guidance”, “-the Prophet”, “-Hadith” or “-some website” on every post is below the level of laymen, considering the resources available nowadays. And lastly, writing just the name of the source book and omitting the number is also frowned upon. Saying that there are multiple numbering schemes out there is nothing more than a weak justification. Surely, you have taken your text from one of those sources, so include the number from where you found it, it’s as easy as that. No excuses, no compromises. A simple, clean citation is all that’s needed. It’s not like you’re making a medium level Thakhrij where you include the name and number of the volume, section, chapter, publisher name and print edition for every hadith. And you’re certainly not making an extended level Thakhrij, where you make a full study detailing all the different chains of narration pertaining to a single hadith, mentioning the differences and commonalities they have, bringing up the status of the narrators, and so on. Basically, if you deem yourself unable to make the most meager of citations to the most sacred of texts, then don’t bother touching those texts at all.</p>

        more than the content we show on the site. Once internal checks have

        While we focus mainly on Hadith and the Sunnah, we also include content on Quran,
        Aqida, Duas, language and other topics whenever it is called for. So
        exactly what book we are working on will constantly be changing from one completed work after another, so consider joining the translation team to be in on the loop. Althought we can definitely say this much; we have a great selection of classical works that we plan to translate in Sha Allah. May Allah grant us the Taufeeq in releasing those books. Ameen.

        We don’t think there’s a need to pin posts just yet. We don’t post a
        full hadith book from start to finish without anything other than that
        in between. Depending on the occasion, we post content relating to
        Friday, Ashura, Eid, Ramadan, etc. These posts-in-between-posts could
        last a day, several days, or even a month. We even repost hadith books
        sometimes. Not to mention that our translations have definitely changed
        since we first posted them. So making use of the site, app, pdf and
        books is a better choice for reading hadith books from start to finish,
        instead of only reading from posts on social media.

        <a><b>What is your Aqeedah?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        My Aqeeda is that of Ahlul Hadith, who are Ahlu Sunnah wal Jama’ah. Everything in this 
        <a href="https://hadithmv.github.io/books/barbahari.html">book</a> I hold to be my belief. I follow the Book of Allah and Sunnah of His Messenger, upon the understanding of the
        Companions and those who followed them in righteousness. I affirm the
        Names and Attributes of Allah just as He and His Messenger ﷺ did, without
        changing their wording, interpreting them as metaphorical, denying them,
        likening them to the creation, or asking how they are. I follow the Righteous Predecessors and took from what they took, and withheld from what they withheld. I hear and obey
        even if a slave is put over me, and I give advice to those in authority
        privately and not on the streets. I accept the Aathar/Narrations as they came, and act upon them as the Righteous Predecessors did. And I do that without imposing my own interpretation on them, or distorting them to fit my view, or coming up with ways to go around them. All of those are deceptions that the people of innovations and desires use in order to reject the Aathar and find ways to escape acting on them.  This is my Aqeedah. And as such, I will not allow any other
        creeds to show up in any of the content here. Another important reason
        why this project had to happen was because of the widespread Ash’ari
        misinterpretations that had been plagued the available Islamic books in
        Maldives. Despite Aqida being a major issue, and the most important of them all, these problems had gone on for too
        long, without enough of an effort being made to cleanse them of the various
        inserted deviations they had. We didn’t even have correct full
        translations of the most basic books of Islam, which are the Quran and
        books of hadith. Yet the Nasara had succeeded in translating the Bible
        to the Maldivian language, and they were even translating Nasrani films as well. Unfortunately, these major issues had persisted throughout
        generations of Maldivians, even with the presence of over 300 Islamic
        graduates. But in sha Allah, we aim to solve that issue.
        May Allah grant us Thaufeeq. Ameen.

        The key idea is to have everything accessible in one place. A
        centralized, unified approach is the most efficient in terms of size,
        speed and development. In short, we did things this way to avoid
        redundancy and bloat. Otherwise a hundred books would be a hundred apps
        on each separate platform, which would be very inefficient to maintain.
        Imagine if the Shamela Islamic Library had a separate program or app for
        each of their books, with multiple database engines that needed
        updating. Now you can understand exactly how difficult and ineffective
        that would be for the end user, as well as the programmer.

        <a><b>Why is it hadithmv.github.io instead of hadithmv.com?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        Also related to this matter, is how some say that writing
        .github.io in the URL of the browser takes too long. In response, I
        would say, who types out full URLs in the browser in this day and age?
        One only needs to google a mere word of the site name and they will find
        themselves there in no time. Not to mention how modern browsers
        autocomplete the URL the moment you write a few letters.
        Nevertheless, while Hadithmv has always been built and hosted on github
        instead of a separate domain, I do own
        <a href="https://hadithmv.com">hadithmv.com</a>. And that website name redirects
        back to this one here on github. I don’t do it the other way around
        because of the temporary nature of custom domains, which in reality only
        last as long as they are maintained and paid for. We have seen time and
        again, how many Islamic sites that were once filled with so much
        content, die off along with everything that was in them. Unfortunately,
        most site owners choose to be exclusive and closed-ended, not making their code and content viewable at the source level, nor making backups, and not sharing their
        data accessibly. So their work ceased to exist because of various
        factors, such as not paying for the costs needed to keep the site up,
        which of course becomes more expensive if one does not know their
        way around technical things, or they became too busy in their personal
        lives to continue with these projects, or they stopped updating their sites to fit
        with modern designs as technology progressed, or disputes arose within
        their team and so they ended up breaking off from each other and thus their
        legacy stagnated, or in the worst case scenario, the content creators
        themselves had to rely all their lives on IT people who came and went
        just like that, or were limited to basic third party software and never
        went beyond the realm of clicking buttons and writing regular text
        just like everyone else. On the other hand, sometimes technically
        inclined people may have wanted to make an Islamic site or app, yet
        didn’t have the acquired Islamic knowledge to do so, and had to rely on
        those who do, but those ended up not having the time, effort or
        consistency required for such a task. The reverse can also happen, where
        people with the needed Islamic knowledge were not able to learn or adapt to
        changing technology, while the brothers in IT were too busy with
        commercial work to devote their time to building an Islamic project. In
        short, conflicts, inabilities, dependencies, bottlenecks and so on, are
        usually what stagnate and kill off such projects. Similar to these
        situations is how some only release their work merely in the form of
        hardcopy books to be placed on shelves, or make do with only a channel
        on limited social media, or worse, give out just a PDF, and don’t bother
        doing any more than that. If only the creators made their content
        available openly on the web and apps, accessible on all media and
        platforms, kept up with the changing trends of development, and had
        proper mirrors and backups, people could have still continued to benefit and built upon 
        even if and when something were to happen to themselves or their site. However, we
        have tried our level best to avoid becoming like that, which is
        ultimately why we are on github and won’t expire or need renewal the way other domains
        do. We have also gone beyond that and prepared several site
        <a href="mirror-backups.html">mirrors</a> to keep the content alive.
        because knowledge is simply too precious to let vanish. And last but not
        the least, in addition to our text content, we have also placed all our
        code out there in public, in addition to making mirrors for that as
        well, so that those who come later on will be able to continue and
        improve upon it. And we expect that more people in the future
        will be able to read and write code compared to today. We also release
        PDFs of our finished works on the internet, as well as print physical
        books to be made available in bookstores. This way, we hope to have
        covered all angles in the most comprehensive approach possible. And all praise is
        for Allah.

        No, that is only something the scholars can do, because the Sharia of
        Allah is not spoken of except with knowledge. While Hadithmv is intended
        to be a resource for various Islamic texts, a single read alone is
        not sufficient for laymen to have formed a comprehensive opinion on a
        matter. Many individuals who do not know even the most basic amount of Arabic think that just
        because they have the internet, they are as capable as any scholar. This
        is nothing but a complete and utter fallacy. You cannot come up with
        your own reasoning nor make up your own analogy when it comes to the religion. That is simply not how things work in Islam. Anything
        related to Aqidah, Fiqh or Fatwa should always be taken from the Righteous Predecessors, the scholars of Hadith, and those who followed in their way. 
        Otherwise, one will only go astray, while leading others astray as well.

      <h3 class="en">
        <a><b>What is the most important thing?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        The most important thing is to have the right Aqidah. Because it is the base, the very foundation. Everything else comes after. And this does not change no matter the place or time. Correct Aqida is the end, the goal, that we are trying to reach, and everything else is just a means to it. The good end does not justify bad means, just as good means do not justify a bad end. All of that is falsehood and deception. As Imam Malik said, “The latter part of this Ummah will never be rectified except by that which rectified the earlier part.” Know that having a
        lot of books, narrations, knowledge, deeds and so on, doesn’t comparatively matter if one does not hold the correct belief, isn’t firmly grounded in understanding Islam the way it was revealed, and doesn’t know Allah and His Messenger or folow them the way the best three generations knew them and followed them.  And ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, may Allah have mercy on him, said, “There is no excuse for anyone going astray thinking that he is upon guidance. Nor for abandoning guidance thinking it to be misguidance, since the affairs have been made clear, the proof established, and the excuse cut off.” And that is because the Aathaar and the Righteous Predecessors have decidedly ruled over (and preserved) all the affairs of the religion. And it has been made clear to the people, so it is upon the people to (obey and) follow. So surrender to their way and beware of rejecting any Athar/Narration. Do not debate and argue about it. Only comply and submit. Do not throw about examples and reason your way out of it. Only accept and affirm. Do not misinterpret its meaning to avoid acting upon it. The meaning is clear and the way the Rightous Predecessors understood and acted upon is clear. Do not try to fit it into your views and narrative. Rather you must fit yourself into it and discard of you what doesn’t. Do not try to find ways around it. It cannot be escaped and neither can you pretend to be blind. Do not leave it for any opinion. Throw those opions to the wall. And do not ever give precedence to your intellect over it. Rather it comes above your intellect whether you understand it or not. Take the texts as the Righteous Predecessors took them, and stop where they stopped. Anything further than that is destruction. You will not be fooling anyone except yourself. And there is no one worse than one whom when the Aathaar is brought to him, he dislikes it, distorts it, and does not act upon it, all so he can reject it. There is no good whatsoever in such a person. And that is the case whether a layman does it, or a so-called practising muslim. As for the former, at least everyone can tell his apparent state and not be decieved in religion. But as for the latter, the problem is that he looks the part outwardly, and so those who don’t know any better are fooled into thinking that he is one who gives Nusrah to the Sunnah. And it is only when he fails to act on the Aathar, and gives precedence to his views, that his reality comes to light, and his averseness to the Aathar becomes manifest. And this is why this imposter is the more dangerous of the two.
