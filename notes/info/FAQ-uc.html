          You can help by rating the app, note that you can rate without showing
          your name if you don't write anything. Another way to assist is by
          sharing hadithmv with your friends. If you ever wanted to spread
          Islamic knowledge in Dhivehi, or maybe even thought about distributing
          a great many books to Maldivians all around the world, then sharing
          hadithmv is as easy as it gets.

          people who are skilled in the Dhivehi and Arabic language, and others

          It started out as a website providing the Dhivehi translation of
          Nawawi's 40 hadith, then later developed into much more than that.
          While the main focus will always be on reviving the Sunnah and making
          it accessible for everyone, it became important to include everything
          that helps in achieving that goal. The most important of which would
          be the Quran, followed by books on the correct Aqida. Supporting
          language material for learning Arabic and translating was also found
          to be indispensable.

          You can read various Islamic translations of Quran, Hadith, Aqida,
          Duas etc. You can use hadithmv like a dictionary. You can find the
          source references for these books. You can lookup texts in Dhivehi as
          well as Arabic, and can search even without Arabic diacritics. You can
          copy and paste the translations from and to any device, through any
          kind of media. You can select how many items to display on the screen
          at one time. You can jump to any page. You can use filter options to
          see only specific texts. You can show and hide different types of
          text. You can use keyboard shortcuts on the desktop.

          If you are on the app then simply fully closing the app and opening it

          search box, clear the selected options, set the number of items viewed
          to default, and deselect the extra fields you have chosen to show. Or
          you can just fully clear the cache from the browser and revisit to
          that page anew.

          If a hadith reference is from Bukhari or Muslim, then it is
          undoubtedly authentic. For any other book, the grading of a hadith
          scholar is required before saying it is authentic. Some references on
          hadithmv do include such gradings, while others do not have them yet.

          We usually rely upon the texts of the Shamela library program, unless

          use the best references we can find even if that is only in a
          hardcover book.

          They are the sayings, actions, approvals as well as the physical
          characteristics and manners of Muhammad ﷺ, the final Prophet sent by
          Allah. Hadith is also called Sunnah. After the Quran, hadith is the
          second source of all sharia legislations as well as behavioural
          etiquette standards in Islam. We can only know what we should and
          should not do through the Messenger ﷺ. Following the Messenger ﷺ is
          the only way to salvation and all that is good, and choosing any other
          path is falling into wretchedness and destruction, in this world as
          well as the next.

          it. This is not just another book that doesn't get updated. Rather it
          is possible to edit and update the text of hadithmv anytime. We are
          always striving to improve and build upon the translations, which are
          too important to just write once and then abandon at some point.

          them, likening them to the creation, or asking how they are. I hear
          and obey even if a slave is put over me, and I give advice to those in
          authority privately and not on the streets. This is what was taught in

          No, that is only something the scholars can do, because the Sharia of
          Allah is not spoken of except with knowledge. While hadithmv is
          intended to be a resource for various Islamic texts, one or two hadith
          alone is not sufficient for layman to have formed a comprehensive
          opinion on a matter. Many individuals who haven not studied even the
          most basic of Islamic books or know even the slightest Arabic think
          that just because they have the internet, they are as capable as any
          scholar. This is nothing but a complete and utter fallacy. You cannot
          come up with your own reasoning nor make up your own analogy when it
          comes to Islamic rulings. That is simply not how things work in this
          Deen. Anything related to fiqh or fatwa should always be directed to
          the real scholars. Otherwise, one will only go astray, while leading
          others astray as well.
