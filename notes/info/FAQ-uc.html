          The hadithmv team is ever expanding. Currently, we are looking for
          people who have skills in three key areas: Dhivehi, Arabic, and
          programming. Roles include translating, proof-reading and coding. Feel
          free to contact us for more information if you would like to know more

        <p class="en justi inde">
          One way is by rating the Android app. Note that you can rate without
          showing your name if you don't write anything. Another way is by
          sharing hadithmv with your friends. If you ever wanted to spread
          Islamic knowledge in Dhivehi, or maybe even thought about distributing
          a great many books to Maldivians all around the world, then sharing
          hadithmv is as easy as it gets. Furthermore, the Prophet ﷺ said:
          “Whoever guides someone to goodness will have a reward like one who
          did it.” -Sahih Muslim 1893

        <p class="en justi inde">
          hadithmv has had various helpers over time. Most of them are friends
          and colleagues from the Islamic University of Madinah, as well as
          other students of knowledge and people who are skilled in the Dhivehi
          and Arabic language, and others who help with the code itself. For a

          that some people are below others, like other bygone projects have

          It started out as a website providing the Dhivehi translation of
          Nawawi's 40 hadith, then later developed into much more than that.
          While the main focus will always be on reviving the Sunnah and making
          it accessible for everyone, it became important to include everything
          that helps in achieving that goal. The most important of which would
          be the Quran, followed by books on the correct Aqida. Supporting
          language material for learning Arabic and translating was also found
          to be indispensable.

          Primarily you can read various Islamic translations of Quran, Hadith,
          Aqidah, Duas etc. You can also use hadithmv like a dictionary. You can
          find the source references for these books. You can lookup texts in
          Dhivehi as well as Arabic, and can search even without Arabic
          diacritics. You can copy and paste the translations to and from any
          device, through any kind of media. You can select how many items to
          display on the screen at one time. You can jump to any page. You can
          use filter options to see only specific texts. You can show and hide
          different types of text. You can use keyboard shortcuts on the
          desktop, etc.

          If you are on the app, then simply closing the app fully and then
          opening it again will reset it. If you are on the web version then
          clear the search box, clear the selected options, set the number of
          items viewed to default, and deselect the extra fields you have chosen
          to show. Or you can just fully clear the cache from the browser and

          <a><b>How is hadithmv different?</b></a>
        </h3>
        <p class="en justi inde">
          It is the first program of its kind in the Dhivehi language, and as
          far as we are aware, the only. Another game-changer is that here at
          hadithmv, we fit with the times. Our content loads as fast as can be,
          and uses a fraction of your data when it does. In more ways than one,
          hadithmv saves you time and money, because every byte counts. We like
          to keep things minimal yet modern. We don't spend our time creating
          flashy animations or searching for filler photographs to go with what
          to write. We realized early on that a one size fits all approach and
          readily available templates does the job much more efficiently. This
          way we can focus on what is important, delivering quality content
          instead of worrying about trivial secondary matters. Nor do we limit
          ourselves to bulky hard-coded PDFs that are hard to read on mobiles,
          and even harder to search text in. Rather our content is responsive
          and easily searchable, with custom options like copying or choosing
          how many items to display. Furthermore, we don't do things in waves
          that come and go, or get people worked up on something for short
          bursts that inevitably fade away. Instead, we aim for steady work and
          sure outcomes that are designed to last. Also, while most books tend
          to be very expensive in the Maldives, we make sure all our physical
          books are extremely affordable, for the sake of spreading the
          knowledge. And when it comes to social media, we keep things
          bite-sized so subscribers can follow up on our content even on a busy
          schedule. These days, there is a lot less need to ferry people or
          books back and forth across the country, that ship has sailed long
          ago. And even PDFs are fast becoming dinosaurs. The generation of
          today expects whole libraries to fit responsively within their pockets
          and be able to use them easily and immediately within a snap, and
          hadithmv is well set to deliver on those expectations, in sha Allah.

        <h3 class="en">
          <a><b>Could you record video and audio to go with the hadith?</b></a>
        </h3>
        <p class="en justi inde">
          Fundamentally, we aim to create content for the source texts, as
          everything is built on that. Once that resource is readily available,
          it becomes easier for everyone else to create multimedia based on it.
          This is why we have chosen to invest most of our time and effort in
          this basic area, as it is more important in the long term than
          spending hours and hours recording and editing other media. As the
          years go by, images will become pixelized and blurry as they keep
          getting reuploaded and compressed over and over again. And videos will
          become outdated and search algorithms will push them further back as
          new ones come out to replace them. As for audio, one thing is how much
          of a hassle it is to go back and rerecord things whenever a change in
          script is called for, and for another, it is inevitable that Dhivehi
          text-to-speech engines will develop to a point where manually
          recording and editing clips will become all but irrelevant. Outlets,
          channels, groups, domains, movements, activities, events, speeches,
          presentations, captions, blog posts, one piece articles etc will all
          come and go. But without a doubt, one thing remains the same; the
          fundamental value of the core text, which will keep getting reused and
          built upon over and over again, and so that is precisely where we have
          chosen to commit to.

          <a><b>How does hadithmv make content so fast?</b></a>
        </h3>
        <p class="en justi inde">
          It is mainly due to modernized workflow and tools, we tend to automate
          things as much as possible. This allows us to create a weeks worth of
          content that otherwise would have taken others months. We avoid doing
          things over and over again and suffice with scripts wherever we can,
          as we find manual repetition to be extremely cumbersome and a waste of
          time. Inevitably, these methods will outstrip all others when it comes
          to performance and delivery, no matter the numbers, even though by the
          Grace of Allah we have writers such that some of them are worth 50
          others. Furthermore we use custom software to keep up with our rapid
          releases, some of which we have mentioned or made available for others
          on the site.

          If a hadith is from Bukhari or Muslim, then it is undoubtedly
          authentic. For any other book, the grading of a hadith scholar is
          required before saying it is authentic. Some references on hadithmv do
          include such gradings, while others do not have them yet.

          specified otherwise. We look for the most accessible source for the

          up. Otherwise we use the numbering order found in the Shamela library
          program. Refer to the source book we used to know the numbering in

          They are the sayings, actions, approvals as well as the physical
          characteristics and manners of Muhammad ﷺ, the final Prophet sent by
          Allah. Hadith is also called Sunnah. After the Quran, hadith is the
          second source of all sharia legislations as well as behavioural
          etiquette standards in Islam. We can only know what we should and
          should not do through the Messenger ﷺ. Following the Messenger ﷺ is
          the only way to salvation and all that is good, and choosing any other
          path is falling into wretchedness and destruction, in this world as
          well as the next.

          We might have corrected it or later wrote a better translation. Here
          at hadithmv we do not believe in writing content once and then
          forgetting it. This is not just another book that doesn't get updated,
          or an article that can never change. Rather it is possible to edit and
          update the text of hadithmv anytime. Think of it in terms of a 'living
          standard'. We are always striving to improve and build upon the
          translations, which are too important to just write once and then
          abandon later on.

        <p class="en justi inde">
          My Aqeeda is that of Ahlu Sunnah wal Jama'ah. I follow the Quran and
          Sunnah upon the understanding of the Companions. I affirm the Names
          and Attributes of Allah as He and His Messenger ﷺ did, without
          changing their wording, interpreting them as metaphorical, denying
          them, likening them to the creation, or asking how they are. I hear
          and obey even if a slave is put over me, and I give advice to those in
          authority privately and not on the streets. This is what I was taught
          at the Islamic University of Madina. And as such, we will not allow
          any other creeds into the translations of hadithmv. Another important
          reason why this project had to happen was because of the widespread
          Ash’ari interpretations that had plagued the existing translations of
          Islamic books such as the Quran, Riyadussaaliheen, Sahih Muslim, etc.
          This had gone on for long enough with no one being able to cleanse
          them of the various inserted deviations and restore them to their
          original purity. Despite Aqida being a major issue, problems such as
          these had still persisted throughout the generations of Maldivians as
          well as over 300 Islamic graduates residing in this small country of
          ours. May Allah make us of those who solve this problem once and for
          all, Ameen.

        <p class="en justi inde">
          The purpose of hadithmv is to have everything accessible in one place.
          A centralized, unified approach is the most efficient in terms of
          size, speed and development. In short, to avoid redundancy and bloat.
          Otherwise a hundred books would be a hundred apps on each separate
          platform, which would be very inefficient to maintain. Imagine if the
          Shamela Islamic Library had a seperate program / app for each of their
          books with multiple database engines to be looked after. Now you can
          understand exactly how difficult that would be to use for the end
          user, and how ineffective that would be to develop as any programmer
          would know.

        <p class="en justi inde">
          No, that is only something the scholars can do, because the Sharia of
          Allah is not spoken of except with knowledge. While hadithmv is
          intended to be a resource for various Islamic texts, one or two hadith
          alone is not sufficient for layman to have formed a comprehensive
          opinion on a matter. Many individuals who haven not studied even the
          most basic of Islamic books or know even the slightest Arabic think
          that just because they have the internet, they are as capable as any
          scholar. This is nothing but a complete and utter fallacy. You cannot
          come up with your own reasoning nor make up your own analogy when it
          comes to Islamic rulings. That is simply not how things work in this
          Deen. Anything related to fiqh or fatwa should always be directed to
          the real scholars. Otherwise, one will only go astray, while leading
          others astray as well.
