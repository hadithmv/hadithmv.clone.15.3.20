        The reason is that some browsers or antivirus software aren’t familiar
        with the program. So they might warn of a potential threat because it
        isn’t recognized. However we have run it through VirusTotal scans as you
        can see

        Not yet. The reason for that being that I myself don’t use an iPhone nor
        am I familiar with the Swift programming language. And I don’t use
        flutter or react native, which might generate a fair bit of overhead and
        bloat, as opposed to how compact the current Android and Windows apps
        are. Even so, iOS, macOS and Linux users can get the same functionality
        as the Android app from the web version of Hadithmv. In sha Allah there
        will be an iOS app,

        We are always looking out for people with skills in three key areas:
        Dhivehi, Arabic, and programming. Roles include translating,
        proof-reading and coding. Primarily, applicants should be optimistic,
        self-motivated, responsive, able to meet deadlines, and not feel
        offended when corrected. Obviously, we cannot work with translations
        that are done whenever one feels like doing it. Rather we follow a
        schedule, calculate our releases, and will not put a project on hold for
        anyone or anything. If there is too much delay on any one end, work will
        immediately be transferred to someone else, so as to not hold things up.

      <h3 class="en">
        <a><b>Why should I join?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        Well, while everyone has felt the lack of Dhivehi translations in the
        public sphere, there hasn’t been a good enough effort made towards that
        till now. Everyone talks about doing it, yet nowhere near enough has
        been done about it. So we decided to get this project up and running,
        and Alhamdulillah, things have progressed a lot since we kickstarted it
        all. And by now, in joining Hadithmv, you’d be signing up for a well
        established project with years of experience, plenty of support, that is
        also open and welcoming. Unlike various other groups, we don’t keep
        ourselves and what we do in the dark, nor do we fail to respond when it
        comes to holding up our commitments. People have already seen that can
        and do actually get things done, as our work is already out there for
        everyone else to access. Furthermore, while some crowds may have one
        resource or another, like a PDF or so, we have already gone well beyond
        that, collecting all that and much more. We also utilize specialized
        tools and modernized resources for the job, which aren’t limited to
        being either just digital or physical, which is the real bottleneck that
        everyone else faces. And this ensures that we are able to get our
        content up and out there as quickly and efficiently as possible, and
        thus the team is able to continuously build upon a proven flow of work,
        instead of having to start out from absolute zero. This is what makes it
        possible for 3 of our people to turn out 300 hadith translations in 3
        months, because of the benefit of advanced tools and management. On the
        other hand, without a comparable setup or innovative process, 30 other
        people might as well take 30 years and still not get anything done. So
        be a part of this project, and help out with making these important
        Islamic text available for all. After the permission of Allah, we are
        only able to release this project because of your help. May Allah reward
        all those who participated in this abundantly and perpetually. Any good
        that comes of this is from Allah, and any shortcomings are from
        ourselves and shaithan. O Allah, please accept and bless this work of
        ours, and make it from our good deeds. Let it be a Sadaqa Jariya
        (continuous charity) that remains until the Day of Judgement. And
        forgive the brothers and sisters who participated in it, guide them to
        the true path, and keep them firm upon it, along with their families and
        friends. Ameen.

        <a><b>Can I work with Hadithmv but be nameless and anonymous?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        While on the one hand that is easy enough to do, take a moment to
        understand the bigger picture here. Yes, we should be sincere and not
        seeking praise. And yes, it’s about the reward and not the credits. Now
        to answer this issue, first of all, because software development is
        involved, it is important that we document our work. Secondly, the way
        of the people of hadith is to record everything, and noting down people
        and what they did is sort of their specialty. Thirdly, imagine if we
        were all nameless and anonymous, thinking it wast he ideal way to go,
        then there would be no direction, no feedback, and no response. Say
        someone found a mistake somewhere, wanted to report it, but because we
        chose to hide ourselves they were never able to make it to us. And even
        if a few of us kept ourselves known while the rest were unreachable,
        people could get busy, contacts could change, and the known could become
        inactive, while the unknown were now active, which brings us back to the
        need to name names. Keeping a log is the responsible thing to do.
        Fourthly, one only needs to manage their heart and intentions, in order
        to be sincere and not praise-seeking, and if done properly, this should
        allow you to take credit for work rightfully done, it’s as simple as
        that. In the very least, allow us to list your Kunyah. And of course
        sisters can work with other sisters on these projects.

        <a><b>How else can I help with Hadithmv?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        One way is by rating the Android app. Note that you can rate without
        showing your name if you don’t write anything. Another way is by sharing
        Hadithmv with your friends. If you ever wanted to spread Islamic
        knowledge in Dhivehi, or maybe even thought about distributing a lot of
        books to Maldivians all around the world, then in this day and age
        sharing Hadithmv is as easy as it gets. Furthermore, the Prophet ﷺ said:
        “Whoever guides someone to goodness will have a reward like one who did
        it.” -Sahih Muslim 1893.

      <p class="en justi inde">
        Hadithmv has had various helpers over time. Most of them are friends and
        colleagues from the Islamic University of Madinah, as well as brothers
        and sisters who studied in other colleges and faculties, along with
        other students of knowledge, skilled linguists in the Dhivehi and Arabic
        languages, and others who help with the code itself. For a list of

        While Hadithmv initially started as a website providing the Dhivehi
        translation of Nawawi’s 40 hadith, it has since developed into much more
        than that. While the primary focus will always be reviving the Sunnah
        and making it accessible for everyone, it became important to include
        everything that would help in achieving that goal. The most important of
        which would be the Quran, followed by books on the correct Aqida.
        Supporting language material regarding Arabic was also found to be
        indispensable. Other useful tools and content have also made available,
        for those who wish to benefit from them. At the same time, it won’t hurt
        non-technical people the slightest if it’s available here either.

        Primarily you can read various Islamic translations of Quran, Hadith,
        Aqidah, Duas as well as other content. You can also use Hadithmv like a
        dictionary. You can find the source references for these books. You can
        look up texts in Dhivehi as well as Arabic, and can search even without
        Arabic diacritics. You can copy and paste the translations to and from
        any device, through any kind of media. You can select how many items to
        display on the screen at one time. You can jump to any page. You can use
        filter options to see only specific texts. You can show and hide
        different types of text. You can also use keyboard shortcuts on the

      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        It is the first program of its kind in the Dhivehi language, and as far
        as we are aware, the only. Another game-changer is that here at
        Hadithmv, we fit with the times. We designed our content to load fast
        and use a fraction of your data. In more ways than one, Hadithmv saves
        you time and money, because every byte counts. Furthermore, we like to
        keep things minimal yet modern. We don’t spend our time creating flashy
        animations or searching for filler photographs to go with what to write.
        We realized early on that a one size fits all approach and readily
        available templates do the job much more efficiently. This way we can
        focus on what is important, delivering quality content instead of
        worrying about trivial secondary matters. Nor do we limit ourselves to
        bulky hard-coded PDFs that are hard to read on mobile devices, and
        sometimes impossible to search text in. Rather our content is responsive
        and easily searchable, with custom options like copying or choosing how
        many items to display. Furthermore, we don’t do things in waves that
        come and go, or get people worked up on something for short bursts that
        inevitably fade away. Instead, we aim for steady work and sure outcomes
        that are designed to last. And when it comes to social media, we keep
        things bite-sized so subscribers can follow along even on a busy
        schedule. These days, there is a lot less need to ferry people or books
        back and forth across the country, that ship has sailed long ago. And
        even PDFs are fast becoming dinosaurs. The generation of today expects
        whole electronic libraries to fit responsively within their pockets and
        be able to use them easily and immediately within a snap, we hope to
        continue delivering on those expectations, in sha Allah.

        Fundamentally, we work with making the source texts available for
        everyone, as everything else is built on that. Once that resource is
        readily out there, it becomes so much easier for others to create
        multimedia based on it. This is why we have chosen to invest most of our
        time and effort in this essential area, as it is more important in the
        long term than spending hours and hours recording or editing other
        media. As the years go by, images will become pixelated and blurry as
        they keep getting reuploaded and compressed over and over again. Videos
        will also become outdated as search algorithms will push them further
        back as new ones come out to replace them. As for audio, one thing is
        how much of a hassle it is to go back and re-record things whenever a
        change in script is called for, and it is almost inevitable that Dhivehi
        text-to-speech engines will progress to a point where they will
        accurately read whole books for us, instead of us having to rely on
        people to keep recording and editing clips all the time just so we can
        listen to them. In brief, we concern ourselves with long term, long
        lasting goals instead of temporary short term ones. Because the reality
        is that a lot of channels, groups, domains, blogs, posts, articles, web
        documents etc. have all come and gone, leaving not a trace of what once
        was. But without a doubt, there is one thing that remains the same; the
        fundamental value of the core text, which will keep getting reused and
        built upon over time and time again, and so that is precisely where we
        have chosen to commit to.

      <p class="en justi inde">
        It is mainly due to our modernized workflow and tools. Instead of
        tediously having to do everything manually, we tend to automate things
        as much as possible. This allows us to create a few months’ worth of
        content that otherwise would have taken others years to do by hand. We
        avoid doing things over and over again and suffice with scripts wherever
        possible, as we find manual repetition to be extremely cumbersome and a
        waste of time. Inevitably, modern methods will always outstrip legacy
        ones when it comes to performance and delivery, no matter the numbers,
        even though by the Grace of Allah we have writers such that some of them
        are worth 30 others. Furthermore, we use a lot of software to help with

        etiquette standards in Islam. We can only know what we should and should
        not do through the Messenger ﷺ. Following the Messenger ﷺ is the only

        that I hold. I follow the Quran and Sunnah upon the understanding of the
        Companions and those who followed them in righteousness. I affirm the
        Names and Attributes of Allah as He and His Messenger ﷺ did, without
        changing their wording, interpreting them as metaphorical, denying them,
        likening them to the creation, or asking how they are. I hear and obey
        even if a slave is put over me, and I give advice to those in authority
        privately and not on the streets. This is what I was taught at the
        Islamic University of Madina. And as such, I will not allow any other
        creeds to show up in any of the content here. Another important reason
        why this project had to happen was because of the widespread Ash’ari
        misinterpretations that had plagued the existing local translations of
        Quran and hadith. This had gone on for too enough without enough people
        coming forth to cleanse them of the various inserted deviations they
        held. Despite Aqida being a major issue, problems such as these still
        persisted throughout generations of Maldivians, even with the presence
        of over 300 Islamic graduates. But in sha Allah, we aim to solve that

        The key idea is to have everything accessible in one place. A
        centralized, unified approach is the most efficient in terms of size,

        redundancy and bloat. Otherwise a hundred books would be a hundred apps
        on each separate platform, which would be very inefficient to maintain.
        Imagine if the Shamela Islamic Library had a seperate program or app for
        each of their books, with multiple database engines that needed
        updating. Now you can understand exactly how difficult and ineffective
        that would be for the end user as well as the programmer.

        <a><b>Why is it hadithmv.github.io instead of hadithmv.com?</b></a>
      </h3>
      <p class="en justi inde">
        Also related to this matter, is how some say that making people write
        .github.io in the URL of the browser will take too long. In response, I
        would say, who types out full URLs in the browser in this day and age?
        One only needs to google a mere word of the site name and they will find
        themselves there in no time. Not to mention how modern browsers
        autocomplete the URL the moment you write even a single letter.
        Nevertheless, while Hadithmv has always been built and hosted on github
        instead of a seperate domain, I do own
        <a href="https://hadithmv.com">hadithmv.com</a>. And that site redirects
        back to this one here on github. I don’t do it the other way around
        because of the temporary nature of custom domains, which in reality only
        last as long as they are maintained and paid for. We have seen time and
        again, how many Islamic sites that were once filled with so much
        content, die off along with everything that was in them. Unfortunately,
        most site owners choose to be exclusive and closed-ended, not allowing
        their content anywhere else, nor making backups, and not sharing their
        data accessibly. So their work ceased to exist because of various
        factors, such as not paying for the costs needed to keep the site up
        which of course becomes much more expensive if one does not know their
        way around code and the web, or they became too busy in their personal
        lives to continue with things, or stopped updating their sites to fit
        with modern times as technology progressed, or disputes arose within
        their team and so they ended up breaking off from each other and their
        legacy stagnated, or in the worst case scenario, the content creators
        themselves had to rely all their lives on IT people who came and went
        just like that, or were limited to basic third party software and never
        went beyond the realm of clicking buttons and writing regular old text
        just like everyone else. On the other hand, sometimes technically
        inclined people may have wanted to make an Islamic site or app, yet
        didn’t have the acquired Islamic knowledge to do so, and had to rely on
        those who do, but those ended up not having the time, effort or
        consistency required for such a task. The reverse can also happen, where
        people with required Islamic knowledge are not able to learn or adapt to
        changing technology, while the brothers in IT are too busy with
        commercial work to devote their time to building an Islamic project. In
        short, conflicts, inabilities, dependencies and bottlenecks etc. are
        usually what stagnate and kill off such projects. Similar to these
        situations is how some only release their work merely in the form of
        hardcopy books to be placed on shelves, or make do with only a channel
        on limited social media, or worse, give out just a PDF, and don’t bother
        doing any more than that. If only the creators made their content
        available openly on the web and apps, accessible on all media and
        platforms, kept up with the changing trends of development, and had
        proper mirrors and backups, people could have still continued to benefit
        even something were to happen to themselves or their site. However, we
        have tried our level best to avoid becoming like that, which is
        ultimately why we are on github and won’t expire the way other domains
        do. We have also gone beyond that and prepared several site
        <a href="mirror-backups.html">mirrors</a> to keep the content alive.
        because knowledge is simply too precious to let vanish. And last but not
        the least, in addition to our text content, we have also placed all our
        code out there in public, in addition to making mirrors for that as
        well, so that those who come later on will be able to continue and
        improve upon it. And we can all expect that more people in the future
        will be able to read and write code than now, of course. We also release
        pdfs of our finished works on the internet, as well as print physical
        books to be made available in bookstores. This way, we hope to have
        covered all angles in a most comprehensive approach. And all praise is
        for Allah.

        No, that is only something the scholars can do, because the Sharia of
        Allah is not spoken of except with knowledge. While Hadithmv is intended
        to be a resource for various Islamic texts, one or two hadith alone is
        not sufficient for laymen to have formed a comprehensive opinion on a
        matter. Many individuals who have not studied even the most basic
        Islamic books or know only the slightest bit of Arabic think that just
        because they have the internet, they are as capable as any scholar. This
        is nothing but a complete and utter fallacy. You cannot come up with
        your own reasoning nor make up your own analogy when it comes to Islamic
        rulings. That is simply not how things work in this Deen. Anything
        related to Fiqh or Fatwa should always be directed to the scholars.
        Otherwise, one will only go astray, while leading others astray as well.
