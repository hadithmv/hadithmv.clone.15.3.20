Student of the Hadith Faculty at the Islamic University of Madina, and Web Developer.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>I have a suggestion / correction / question. How can I contact you?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Simply click on the ‚ÄòContact Us‚Äô button on the lower right of this page.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Is Hadithmv on social media?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Yes, we can be found on Facebook, Viber, Telegram, Instagram and Twitter. See the very <a onclick=window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight) style=cursor:pointer>bottom</a> of this page for links.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How do I use Hadithmv?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Please read about that <a href=../how-to-use-hmv.txt>here</a>.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How do I continue from the last place I was at a later time?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">In the web version of Hadithmv, the page will stay as is even if you close the browser, or alternatively you can save the URL. Otherwise you can note down the page number where you were and later input that number to continue exactly from there, and this method can also be used in the app. You can also grab the web URL from within the app itself if you click the "copy current page link" button at the bottom of a page, and save that link for later use.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Is there an app?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Yes. While Hadithmv is primarily available online on the web, it is also available offline as an Android and Windows app.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Is there an iOS app?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Not yet. However, iOS, macOS and Linux users can get the same functionality as the Android app from the mobile web version of Hadithmv. In sha Allah there will be an iOS app, contact us if you would know someone who could help in that area.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Can I join the Hadithmv project?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">We are always looking out for people with skills in three key areas: Dhivehi, Arabic, and programming. Roles include translating, proof-reading and coding. Primarily, applicants should be optimistic, self-motivated, responsive, able to meet deadlines, and not feel offended when corrected. Obviously, we cannot work with translations that are done whenever one feels like doing it. Rather we follow a schedule, calculate our releases, and will not put a project on hold for anyone or anything. If there is too much delay on any one end, work will immediately be transferred to someone else, so as to not hold things up. That said, feel free to contact us to know more about joining Hadithmv. As for why you should join us; while everyone has felt the lack of Dhivehi translations in the public sphere, there hasn‚Äôt been a good enough effort made for towards that til now. Everyone talks about doing it, yet virtually nothing has been done about. Then we decided to get things going, and alhamdulillah, we‚Äôve grown a lot since we kickstarted this project. And by now, in joining Hadithmv, you‚Äôd be signing up for a well established project with years of experience, plenty of support, that is also open and welcoming. Unlike other various groups, we don‚Äôt keep ourselves and what we do in the dark, nor do we fail to respond when it comes to holding up our commitments. People have already seen that we do in fact actually get things done, as our work is already out there for everyone to access. Furthermore, while some people may have one resource or another, like a PDF or a particular book, we have already gone beyond that, collecting all that and much more. We also utilize specialized tools and modernized resources for the job, which aren‚Äôt limited to being either just digital or physical, which is the real bottleneck that everyone else faces. And this ensures that we are able to get our content up and out there as quickly and efficiently as possible, and thus the team is able to continuously build upon a proven flow of work, instead of having to start out from absolute zero.</p><br><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How else can I help Hadithmv?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">One way is by rating the Android app. Note that you can rate without showing your name if you don't write anything. Another way is by sharing Hadithmv with your friends. If you ever wanted to spread Islamic knowledge in Dhivehi, or maybe even thought about distributing a lot of books to Maldivians all around the world, then in this day and time sharing Hadithmv is as easy as it gets. Furthermore, the Prophet Ô∑∫ said: ‚ÄúWhoever guides someone to goodness will have a reward like one who did it.‚Äù -Sahih Muslim 1893.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Who else has participated in the Hadithmv project?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Hadithmv has had various helpers over time. Most of them are friends and colleagues from the Islamic University of Madinah, as well as other students of knowledge, skilled people in the Dhivehi and Arabic languages, and others who help with the code itself. For a list of contributors please click <a href=contributors.html>here</a>. Note that here at Hadithmv, we utilize this <a href=https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/overview>specification</a> when it comes to contributions, because we realize that people like you and me are giving themselves and their free time to contribute in so many ways. That said, we will not allow false Aqidas to be hosted here on Hadithmv.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Why is it called Hadithmv? and why are there other than hadith in it?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">While hadithmv initially started as a website providing the Dhivehi translation of Nawawi‚Äôs 40 hadith, it has since developed into much more. While the primary focus will always be on reviving the Sunnah and making it accessible for everyone, it became important to include everything that helps in achieving that goal. The most important of which would be the Quran, followed by books on the correct Aqida. Supporting language material regarding Arabic was also found to be indispensable. Other useful tools and content have also made available, for those who wish to benefit from them.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What can I do on Hadithmv?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Primarily you can read various Islamic translations of Quran, Hadith, Aqidah, Duas as well as other content. You can also use Hadithmv like a dictionary. You can find the source references for these books. You can lookup texts in Dhivehi as well as Arabic, and can search even without Arabic diacritics. You can copy and paste the translations to and from any device, through any kind of media. You can select how many items to display on the screen at one time. You can jump to any page. You can use filter options to see only specific texts. You can show and hide different types of text. You can also use keyboard shortcuts on the desktop, etc.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>I messed up the search / settings on Hadithmv, how do I reset things?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">If you are on the app, then simply closing the app fully and then opening it again will reset it. If you are on the web version then clear the search box, clear the selected options, set the number of items viewed to default, and deselect the extra fields you have chosen to show. Or you can just fully clear the cache from the browser and revisit to that page again by pressing (Ctrl + Shift + R).</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Is Hadithmv free?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">We are providing our content free of charge, and it will remain that way, in sha Allah. Because we know first-hand that knowledge does not decrease when shared and made accessible to all, it only increases.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Who funds Hadithmv?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Hadithmv is currently funded by the developer and no one else. And all praise is for Allah.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How is Hadithmv different?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">It is the first program of its kind in the Dhivehi language, and as far as we are aware, the only. Another game-changer is that here at Hadithmv, we fit with the times. We designed our content to load fast, and uses a fraction of your data when it does. In more ways than one, Hadithmv saves you time and money, because every byte counts. Furthermore, we like to keep things minimal yet modern. We don't spend our time creating flashy animations or searching for filler photographs to go with what to write. We realized early on that a one size fits all approach and readily available templates does the job much more efficiently. This way we can focus on what is important, delivering quality content instead of worrying about trivial secondary matters. Nor do we limit ourselves to bulky hard-coded PDFs that are hard to read on mobile devices, and even harder to search text in. Rather our content is responsive and easily searchable, with custom options like copying or choosing how many items to display. Furthermore, we don‚Äôt do things in waves that come and go, or get people worked up on something for short bursts that inevitably fade away. Instead, we aim for steady work and sure outcomes that are designed to last. And when it comes to social media, we keep things bite-sized so subscribers can follow along even on a busy schedule. These days, there is a lot less need to ferry people or books back and forth across the country, that ship has sailed long ago. And even PDFs are fast becoming dinosaurs. The generation of today expects whole libraries to fit responsively within their pockets and be able to use them easily and immediately within a snap, we hope to continue delivering on those expectations, in sha Allah.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Could you record video and audio to go with the hadith?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Fundamentally, we aim to create content for the source texts, as everything is built on that. Once that resource is readily available, it becomes easier for everyone else to create multimedia based on it. This is why we have chosen to invest most of our time and effort in this essential area, as it is more important in the long term than spending hours and hours recording or editing other media. As the years go by, images will become pixelized and blurry as they keep getting reuploaded and compressed over and over again. Videos will also become outdated as search algorithms will push them further back as new ones come out to replace them. As for audio, one thing is how much of a hassle it is to go back and re-record things whenever a change in script is called for, and it is almost inevitable that Dhivehi text-to-speech engines will develop to a point, where they will accurately read whole books for you, instead of you having to rely on people to keep recording and editing clips all the time just so you can listen in on them. In brief, we concern ourselves with long term, long lasting goals instead of temporary short term ones. Because the reality is that a lot of channels, groups, domains, events, presentations, captions, blogs, posts, articles etc. have all come and gone, leaving not a trace of what once was. But without a doubt, there is one thing that remains the same; the fundamental value of the core text, which will keep getting reused and built upon over and over again, and so that is precisely where we have chosen to commit to.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How does Hadithmv make content so quickly?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">It is mainly due to our modernized workflow and tools. Instead of tediously having to do everything manually, we tend to automate things as much as possible. This allows us to create a week‚Äôs worth of content that otherwise would have taken others months to do by hand. We avoid doing things over and over again and suffice with scripts wherever possible, as we find manual repetition to be extremely cumbersome and a waste of time. Inevitably, modern methods will always outstrip legacy ones when it comes to performance and delivery, no matter the numbers, even though by the Grace of Allah we have writers such that some of them are worth 50 others. Furthermore, we use custom software to keep up with our releases, some of which we have mentioned or made available for use on the site.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Where is Hadithmv based?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">In the Maldives, although most of the code and content was written in Medina.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Who is Hadithmv for?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Quite simply, everyone Maldivian. From students to teachers, children to parents, and seekers of knowledge to scholars, etc.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Is Hadithmv affiliated with any organization, whether governmental or an NGO?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">No, Hadithmv is not affiliated with any organization. This project is run independantly and unaffected by the influences of third parties. And all praise is for Allah.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Are the translations correct?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">In sha Allah. We strive to make them as accurate and understandable as possible. However, if you do find an inaccuracy somewhere, or even a better suggestion, please report it to us so that we may correct it as soon as possible. Contact links can be found at the bottom of this page. Also note that not everything is to be translated literally, and the overall meaning must be preserved when conveying the texts. Unfortunately, we see some people trying on their own to piece together a translation word-for-word, and then end up failing to understand both the text as well as the context. It is important to point out that just a dictionary will never, ever be enough to translate Islamic books. One must have proper knowledge of Islamic sciences such as Nahu, Fiqh, Usool, Mustalah, Ruwat, etc. and even then, they must refer to the Explanations of the scholars if they wish to translate anything correctly. Otherwise people will just end up misleading themselves as well as others.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Are the translations approved by the Islamic Ministry?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">The translated books which have been approved by the Islamic Ministry will have an approval reference number on its page. While others maybe still in the making or pending approval.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Are all the hadith here authentic?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">If a hadith is from Bukhari or Muslim, then it is undoubtedly authentic. For any other book, the grading of a hadith scholar is required before saying it is authentic. Some references on Hadithmv do include such gradings, while others do not have them yet.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How do you source your arabic text?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">We usually rely upon the texts of the Shamela library program, unless specified otherwise. We look for the most accessible source for the text, as that is what most people will find most easily available, then we use the best references we can find even if its from a hardcover book.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What numbering system do you use to reference hadith?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">We usually use the indexing scheme of Muhammad Fuad Abdul Baaqi wherever possible, as it is the most commonly used and easiest to look up. Otherwise we use the numbering order found in the Shamela library program. Refer to the source book we used to know the numbering in place.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>When I looked up the reference number from a source, why did it not match?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Different editions and prints may use different numbering schemes. Make sure that you looked up the same source books that we ourselves took the numberings from.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What are hadith?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">They are the sayings, actions, approvals as well as the physical characteristics and manners of Muhammad Ô∑∫, the final Prophet sent by Allah. Hadith is also called Sunnah. After the Quran, hadith is the second source of all Sharia legislations as well as behavioural etiquette standards in Islam. We can only know what we should and should not do through the Messenger Ô∑∫. Following the Messenger Ô∑∫ is the only way to salvation and all that is good, and choosing any other path is falling into wretchedness and destruction, in this world as well as the next.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What is Takhrij?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Takhreej is referencing the hadith text to the source book from which it is originally found.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Is there a dark mode / night theme?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">The site automatically switches the theme based on your system preferences, however the app does not as of yet.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What fonts does Hadithmv use?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Mvtypewriter and Yakout.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Why is the site different from the app?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">The site gets updated first, so the latest changes will always be available there. We only roll updates to the app later, so that we can be sure everything has worked out smoothly on the site beforehand. This is why the site will always have a higher version than the app.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Why is a translation different from before?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">We might have corrected it or later wrote a better translation. Here at Hadithmv we do not believe in writing content once and then forgetting it. This is not just another book that doesn‚Äôt get updated, or an article that can never change. Rather it is possible to edit and update the text of Hadithmv anytime. Think of it in terms of a ‚Äòliving standard‚Äô. We are always striving to improve and build upon the translations, which are too important to just write once and then abandon later on.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Why is a book on Hadithmv incomplete?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Most likely because it is still in the process of being written and checked, it will be fully available once ready, in sha Allah.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Could I know more about a particular book?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Check if there's a link to an about page where that book is found. Otherwise feel free to contact us for more information.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Which books are currently available?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">You can find those on the main page. We might have some other books in the making, but are awaiting further checks before being shared publicly. The content we have drafted and kept in-waiting is actually more than the content we show on the site. Once internal checks have progressed to a point that we are satisfied with, it then becomes available for public release.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Which books will be available soon?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">While we focus mainly on hadith, we also include content on Quran, Aqida, Duas, language and other topics whenever it is appropriate. So exactly what book we are working on will constantly be changing, so consider joining the translation team to be in on the loop.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Are there any physical books I can get?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Our physical books are available from Message of Islam. Contact them at 7330557 or 3344797 to know more.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Does Hadithmv have any mirrors, in case the main site is down?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Yes, click <a href=mirror-backups.html>here</a> to see them.</p><br><h3 class=en><a>What will happen to Hadithmv if something happens to you?</a></h3><p class="en inde justi">That has been discussed within the team, and we have protocols in place so that the project may continue with or without me. It has already been decided which people are to take over and direct the project, so there should be no worries about our work stopping, in sha Allah.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What is your Aqeedah?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">My Aqeeda is that of Ahlu Sunnah wal Jama'ah. These are the <a href=https://hadithmv.github.io/books/barbahari.html>beliefs</a> I hold. I follow the Quran and Sunnah upon the understanding of the Companions. I affirm the Names and Attributes of Allah as He and His Messenger Ô∑∫ did, without changing their wording, interpreting them as metaphorical, denying them, likening them to the creation, or asking how they are. I hear and obey even if a slave is put over me, and I give advice to those in authority privately and not on the streets. This is what I was taught at the Islamic University of Madina. And as such, we will not allow any other creeds to show up in any of the content here. Another important reason why this project had to happen was because of the widespread Ash‚Äôari misinterpretations that had plagued the existing local translations of Quran and hadith. This had gone on for too enough without sufficient people coming forth to cleanse them of the various deviations that were inserted. Despite Aqida being a major issue, problems such as these still persisted throughout generations of Maldivians even with the presence of over 300 Islamic graduates. But in sha Allah, we aim to solve that issue once and for all. May Allah grant us Thaufeeq. Ameen.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Why do you call yourself Yahya‚Äôs Dad / Abu Yahya?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">That is my Kunyah, which is a kind of Arabic nickname where a person is called after their first child.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>When did you start Hadithmv?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Jul 17, 2017. Back when I had finished 2 years at the Mauhad of Arabic language, and had a break before transitioning to the Mauhad of Thanawi at Madina.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Has the Hadithmv logo changed?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Yes. Initially I made it with English letters. Later I changed it to something more Maldivian, the lettering of which was designed by Mohamed Mafaz Ahmed.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>How is Hadithmv licensed as a software?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Please read about that <a href=../../LICENSE.txt>here</a>.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>What tools was Hadithmv made with?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">Please read about that <a href=../third-party-libs-and-tools.txt>here</a>.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>Why not make separate apps for all of the books?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">The key idea is to have everything accessible in one place. A centralized, unified approach is the most efficient in terms of size, speed and development. In short, we did things this way to avoid redundancy and bloat. Otherwise a hundred books would be a hundred apps on each separate platform, which would be very inefficient to maintain. Imagine if the Shamela Islamic Library had a seperate program or app for each of their books, with multiple database engines that needed updating. Now you can understand exactly how difficult and ineffective that would be for the end user as well as the programmer.</p><br><h3 class=en><a><b>I learned about a hadith, can I issue Fatwa or answer Fiqh questions?</b></a></h3><p class="en inde justi">No, that is only something the scholars can do, because the Sharia of Allah is not spoken of except with knowledge. While Hadithmv is intended to be a resource for various Islamic texts, one or two hadith alone is not sufficient for layman to have formed a comprehensive opinion on a matter. Many individuals who have not studied even the most basic Islamic books or know even the slightest Arabic think that just because they have the internet, they are as capable as any scholar. This is nothing but a complete and utter fallacy. You cannot come up with your own reasoning nor make up your own analogy when it comes to Islamic rulings. That is simply not how things work in this Deen. Anything related to Fiqh or Fatwa should always be directed to the scholars. Otherwise, one will only go astray, while leading others astray as well.</p><br></div><script>function openTab(e,t){for(var a,l=document.getElementsByClassName("tabcontent"),n=0;n<l.length;n++)l[n].style.display="none";for(a=document.getElementsByClassName("tablinks"),n=0;n<a.length;n++)a[n].className=a[n].className.replace(" active","");document.getElementById(t).style.display="block",e.currentTarget.className+=" active"}document.getElementById("defaultOpen").click()</script><br><hr><h2 class="en mid testimonials">‚Äì ¬†Feedback¬† ‚Äì</h2><ul class=quotes id=quotes><li class=show>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê<span class=stars></span>‚ÄúThis is a very needed app for the maldivian community.
