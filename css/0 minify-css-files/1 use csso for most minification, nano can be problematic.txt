npm install cssnano postcss postcss-cli -g
without [ --save-dev]

save this:
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        require('cssnano')({
            preset: 'default',
        }),
    ],
};

as a postcss.config.js file  in the root of npm
C:\Users\ashra\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules

minify with:
postcss input.css > output.css

...

it worked for a while, then had problems again. minified files were way too large when done by cssnano. also cssnano messes up some characters in minification.

so use csso for most things, and cssnano but manually in this folder, dont run scripts minifying with cssnano, just csso for scripts
