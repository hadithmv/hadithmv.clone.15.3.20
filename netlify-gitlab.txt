Creating a blank project has this issue
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/202131

instead do:

Create a project
CI/CD for external repo
Connect repositories from Github
Find name and connect
wait till it syncs
go to project

....if not done before:
on the repo > setup CI/CD
Apply a template > jekyll > commit changes
Run pipleline....


for these 2 errors:
	You won't be able to pull or push project code via SSH until you add an SSH key to your profile
	You won't be able to pull or push project code via HTTPS until you set a password on your account
do https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "yahyasdadmv@gmail.com"
Enter
write passphrase twice
run agent:
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
enter pass
on github click profile > settings > ssh keys > add
Copy the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard, paste in key
title: hmvSsh

now back to gitlab, paste that as ssh key

now that that's done, set a password on acc

Pull: for mirroring a repository from another location to GitLab. 
this requires paid packages from gitlab, for pull only

should be able to use
https://username.gitlab.io/projectname
https://hadithmv.gitlab.iohadithmv-github-io

but this has username and proj in the url, also links will break inside the webpage
so go to settings, general, rename Project name from hadithmv-github-io to hadithmv
go down, Change path from hadithmv-github-io to hadithmv.gitlab.io
after a while it should work
