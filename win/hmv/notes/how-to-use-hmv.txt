Thank you for choosing Hadithmv, The Maldivian Platform for Translations of the Sunnah.

Hadithmv is available online as a website, as well as an offline application on both Android and Windows.

---------------------

* General Usage:

Click on the top navbar or right hamburger button to open the menu.
Open a book to begin browsing.
Use the search box to look up words.
Use the show 1 box to select how many items to show. (We recommend this not be changed for the best reading experience, unless you wish to copy multiple items at once)
Use the page buttons to move forward or backward. (Can also swipe to change pages on mobile, which is much easier)
Write in the page box to jump to a page. (Can also use arrow keys once inside the box)
Use the Options button to filter data.
Use the Copy button to copy all visible data.
Use the Extra Columns button to show or hide specific data.

In the top menu, click on the Hadithmv logo at the left to go back to the homepage.

After searching, you can double click on a search result to jump to the page where that result comes from.
For exact matches only, write your search term within quotes "like this"

If you are using Hadithmv from the website, the place where you were reading stays saved even if you close the browser. As for the app, you can click the "copy current page link" button at the bottom of a page and save that link to continue from there later on.

* Desktop Keyboard Shortcuts:
(These work after you have clicked somewhere on the text first)
[Tab] = Tab Navigation
[Arrow keys] = Keyboard Navigation
[Shift + s] = Show Additional Columns
[Shift + c] = Copy shown text to clipboard
[Shift + f] = Open Filter
[Shift + L] = Copy current page as web URL to clipboard

Cursor starts already inside the search box on desktop
(So to use desktop keyboard shortcuts, you must click outside the search box first)

You can save a complete webpage (ctrl + s) for offline use
