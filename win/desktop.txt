copy files from android assets to here, not the other way around
so give two index files, one in root, other in subdir (exact copy)

index is exact same as apk assets index file
for win desktop app, index has to be at root dir, not sub dirs which are possible in apks

open index in dhc, save as hadithmv.dhc one dir back


should keep ico file outsize compile dir to reduce size
	~hadithmv.github.io\img\logo\newLogo7-roundedSquare\newLogo7-roundedSquare.ico
should keep dhc outside compile dir too, else created exe's get repacked into the next exe, unless exe mask has been flagged

...
dont have to go back a dir for css and js and then go foward a dir
../css/COMBcss.min.css	this html wont work in browser
but in compiler and exe it will work as css/COMBcss.min.css on execute
(this is not true for apks)


<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/COMBcss.css" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.href='css/COMBcss.min.css';" />
    <!-- this works as fallback but causes FOUC in apk app, but not in win app where this is needed -->

<script defer src="../js/resc/COMBjs.js"></script>
this is as is as are otehr scripts

including edge installer so that pre win10 chromium edge browserless comps can run it, will make app too large, over 100mb.

ico sizes should be resized and built one by one for quality

then compress with upx (fpux):
upx64.exe --ultra-brute --compress-icons=3 --lzma <input_file>
or just brute
or just 7zip

del exe from repo
