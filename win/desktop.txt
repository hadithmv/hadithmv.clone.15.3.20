for win desktop app, index has to be at root dir, not sub dir like with apk

open index in dhc, save as hadithmv.dhc one dir back


should keep ico file outsize compile dir to reduce size
should keep dhc outside compile dir too, else created exe's get repacked into the next exe, unless exe mask has been flagged

had to change go back a dir for css into go foward a dir

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/COMBcss.min.css" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.href='css/COMBcss.min.css';" />
    <!-- this works as fallback but causes FOUC in apk app, but not in win app where this is needed -->

but for some reason don't have to change for js
<script defer src="../js/resc/COMBjs.js"></script>
this is as is as are otehr scripts

	Information
app name: hadithmv
legal copyright: yahyasdadmv
company name: hadithmv
file description: hadithmv (shows up on task manager)
File version:
Product version:

contents > can add *.exe mask here to exclude those redundant exes, as well as *7z.
window > custom size > first cut out width and height leave those blank, then 
min width: 1680
min height: 1050
max width: 1920
max height: 1080
(any spaces after numbers will break resolution)

compilations > output execs for 64 bit only for now because it loads up faster, even if 32 bit is more supported (for now) and smaller in size

including edge installer so that pre win10 chromium edge browserless comps can run it, will make app too large, over 100mb.

ico sizes should be resized and built one by one for quality

then compress with upx (fpux):
upx64.exe --ultra-brute --compress-icons=3 --lzma <input_file>
or just brute
or just 7zip

del exe from repo
